  "description": "This module was assigned to you because you have experienced a traumatic event or ongoing trauma that may be impacting your well-being. You will be asked to think about things that may be disturbing or upsetting. The main purpose of this module is to educate you about trauma, its possible impacts, and when more intensive treatment would be a good idea. This module is not going to help you “get over” trauma. If you become distressed at any point, call a trusted friend, your supervision officer, or dial 988 for a 24-hour crisis hotline. You got this!",

It can also be used to demonstrate the need to change thoughts, feelings, and behavior to stop the cycle of these experiences impacting your life. Visit My Journal for writing space so you can record your thoughts and feelings and The Resource Center for meditation and calming exercises. You should also tell your probation officer and/or counselor that you are working on trauma so they can help you when you need it. If you feel comfortable, tell people you trust that you are starting this work. You don’t need to tell them everything about your trauma, just that you are embarking on this journey. Their support will help. <br>**This module is not meant to replace seeing a counselor. It is meant to bring awareness to trauma and help you understand it and it can be hurtful. The module will teach you some skills, but this will likely not be enough for you. Talking to your supervising officer or a quick internet search may help you find someone in your area or through telehealth who can best help you. You may also be able to find a trauma survivor’s support group in your area.**",

          "prompt": "Some people do not like thinking about their past for lots of reasons. Some people had to grow up fast and did not have an enjoyable or loving childhood. Others experienced abuse at some point in their lives, such as being physically abused by a parent or being forced to have unwanted sex with a romantic partner or stranger. Sometimes, these experiences are so bad or hurtful to people, they are considered trauma. <br> Trauma is a deeply distressing or disturbing event or series of events that causes physical and/or emotional pain for the person who experienced it. Yes—trauma can be emotional or so-called “psychological.” It does not need to involve actual physical violence. Trauma can range from everyday life circumstances (like living in a bad neighborhood or being bullied) to events where your life is at risk. Trauma is less about the actual event and more about how the event impacts the person who experienced it. It’s important to know that some people respond to bad situations differently. The same event may cause lasting distress for one person but may have little to no impact on another. A reaction to a traumatic event can also happen at different times. Some people respond to trauma right away, while others may react later. Trauma for some people takes time to “sink in.” For still others, it may take time to even realize that what happened to them was wrong. Just because you didn’t have a big reaction at the time of the event, doesn’t mean you can’t have one later or that your response is any less important. <br><b> Examples of events that are usually seen as traumatic include: <ul><li>• Being hit, beaten, burned, or severely punished by an adult, parent, or babysitter.</li><li> Being told you are worthless, unloved, unimportant, or other hurtful things by an adult or important family member. </li><li> Being forced to accept or participate in sex or sex acts with another person, including friends, family members, romantic partners, and strangers. </li><li> Being forced to be by yourself for excessively long periods of time (like days without human contact), whether it was because of military training, prison procedures, or punishment from a parent. </li><li> Being neglected as a child such that you went without clean clothes, food, water, or stable housing. </li><li> A serious accident or natural disaster, like earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, car accidents, or house fires. </li><li> A life-threatening incident or a near-death experience, such as being robbed at gunpoint or nearly falling off of a cliff while hiking. </li><li> Watching someone else - a stranger or someone you care about - in a serious accident or natural disaster or have a life-threatening or near-death experience. </li><li> Watching someone die or get seriously injured. </li><li> Oppression or marginalization caused by racism, sexism, or other forms of discrimination. </li></ul> If you have experienced any of the events listed above or similar events in your life, you may have a lot going through your mind right now. Feeling stressed out, anxious, depressed, or nervous are all common responses to trauma. A lot of people who have experienced a traumatic event will replay the event in their mind, have dreams where they relive the experience, or become paranoid when reminded of these experiences. People may experience sadness, social isolation, or no longer enjoy things they used to enjoy (signs of depression), and other people may experience nervousness, shakiness, worrying, and intrusive thoughts (signs of anxiety), all because of an event or series of events that happened to them. Trauma can also make people feel numb or disconnected from reality—like nothing bad ever happened. Particularly if you have been living in a traumatic experience for a while, you may begin to see it as normal. If you’ve had events like this happen to you before, it’s also okay if you are not having any negative reactions right now. Whatever emotions you are feeling or not feeling is okay. This module will encourage you to explore your feelings.",

      "text": "Some traumatic events are rare, but it is common for people to experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetime. In fact, more than half of all men and women in the U.S. have experienced at least one type of traumatic event. Research tells us some traumatic events are more likely to happen to men and some are more likely to happen to women. <br> Men are more likely to experience trauma in the forms of...<ul><li> Physical accidents and injuries </li><li> Physical punishment in childhood</li><li> Nonsexual assault </li><li> Domestic violence while growing up</li><li> Witnessing someone's injury or death </li><li> Substance abuse (like alcohol) in immediate family</li><li> Natural disasters and fires </li><li> Combat exposure and war-related trauma. </li></ul> Women are more likely to experience trauma in the forms of...<ul><li> Sexual assault </li><li> Parental conflict growing up</li><li> Child sexual abuse </li></ul> BUT, research also shows that all people experience all forms of trauma. Some men are also victims of child sexual abuse and sexual assault, and some women are also victims of combat exposure and war-related trauma. So, while it's true that some trauma is more likely to happen to men or women, anyone can be negatively affected by traumatic events and there are no rules on who is allowed to be impacted by certain events. We also know from research that 90% of people with a mental illness have experienced at least one type of traumatic event. Although we do not yet know why people with mental illnesses are more likely to live through traumatic experiences, we do know that experiencing a traumatic event can make a mental illness worse or trigger a mental illness. If you ignore your symptoms, stuff down your emotions, or don't talk about your trauma with others, it can keep you from feeling better emotionally and physically and moving on with your life in a healthy way. Part of being on supervision is to create a healthier and safer lifestyle, so not working through your feelings may make it harder to be successful on community supervision. ",

Traumatic events are often very serious events in people’s lives, as they can include abuse, pain, betrayal, witnessing the death of a loved one or the threat of your own death. Because they are so serious, people who have experienced trauma often feel distressed when thinking or talking about it. As you may have noticed so far, just reading about examples of trauma can make us feel uneasy, worrisome, unsafe, or mad. These feelings can be uncomfortable for people, which is why they avoid talking about it. While avoiding the discomfort feels better in the moment, it is not very helpful in the long-term.

When people work through bad memories, it can cause these bad memories—and new ones you hadn’t even thought of yet—to pop up in your head at random times like at work, at your mom’s big birthday party, or while meeting with your supervision officer. You may be tempted to think about your trauma memories during these random times, but this can lead to uncomfortable feelings that you are not able to cope with in the moment. You need time to calm back down and get back on track. It’s like being out to sea without a life raft. When trauma-related feelings surface at inconvenient times, you use a time-out box to keep those bad memories from bothering you or the people around you. A time-out box can lock up whatever thoughts or emotions are upsetting to you for a good and long time out. You have the key and can unlock it later when you're ready to think about those thoughts and feel those emotions. Remember, this box is to temporarily hold back memories and feelings, not to permanently forget about them. The box is so your emotions don’t get the better of you at the wrong times.",

After a few minutes, you should find that you relax and don’t feel as angry anymore. Then, you can finish doing what you were doing before you got upset, and you have a positive, productive day. In a way, this technique is a bit like thought stopping. You can say, “No, I’m not thinking about this now. I don’t have time. It’s going in the box!” Remember the box will help you set aside traumatic thoughts and reactions when the time is not right; it is not meant to lock away these thoughts forever.

Other people may feel their trauma is so stressful or upsetting that they try to pretend it never happened—they know something bad happened but keep their experience hidden to feel protected. In other words, people put these thoughts and feelings about trauma into a box and avoid opening it again. Avoidance is different from your time-out box. The time-out box is temporary and only used when it’s not the right time or place to think about trauma. You have the key to this box and can re-open it when you’re ready. People who choose to ignore their reactions to trauma want to keep the box closed forever. <br> Other people may acknowledge the event but insist nothing bad happened or that the event was justified. So, they don’t see the event as traumatic. A wife forced to have sex by her husband may see it has part of her wifely duties rather than as abusive. In very rare cases, people may forget the event completely. These are called ¬repressed memories. Forgetting about the trauma can be the brain’s way of protecting you from thinking about something terrible that you witnessed or went through. But repressed memories are not helpful because they keep you from getting help. However, be careful not to allow people to put bad memories of things that never actually happened in your head! Our minds are fragile and research shows that we can sometimes “remember” things that never happened to us. Be open to the possibility that you may not remember everything about a traumatic event, but don’t let other people (especially people who weren't even there!) “feed” details of an event to you; your brain may just fill in the gaps with details that aren’t true.

One morning, Irvin took forever in the bathroom. Cecil was pissed because he had to get ready for work too but couldn't because Irvin was taking too long. Cecil finally pounded on the bathroom door and yelled \"Dude, hurry the hell up! You're not the only one with a life!\" Irvin didn't say anything back, and Cecil didn't hear any movement in the bathroom. Cecil opened the door and saw Irvin lying on the bathroom floor in a puddle of vomit. Cecil started to panic thinking Irvin was dead. Cecil called emergency services and an ambulance picked up Irvin. It turns out Irvin's medications led to a bad reaction when he took them all together, causing him to lose consciousness. Now, two months later, Cecil still \"jumps\" when he open the bathroom door in his home. He constantly feels guilty about how rude he had been to Irvin that morning, and refuses to take any medications because he worries they will kill him. </i> ",

      "text": "Sometimes, traumatic events can even change what we think is the truth. Notice that Cecil thought that taking any medication would kill him? In reality, thousands of medications are safe to take and have minimal side effects. Many medications can even be taken together without serious side effects when monitored by a physician. But the traumatic event made it hard for Cecil to believe this. People can also alter or misinterpret facts about who \"caused\" a traumatic event or who is to blame. The fact that Cecil continues feeling guilty for being rude to Irvin sends the signal \"If I weren't rude to Irvin, he would have never gotten sick.\" Even though this is impossible (treating someone poorly does not change the way their medications will affect their body), Cecil still blames himself. <br> Research shows that there are some ways in which a person's view of the world can be most often changed by trauma. These include feelings of safety, control, and self-esteem, as well as attitudes toward trusting others, power, and intimacy in relationships. These are discussed next. <br> <ul><li><b>Safety:</b> Feelings of safety include whether you feel you can keep yourself or others safe, and whether you feel other people care about or are capable of keeping you safe. Trauma, especially that involving physical accidents, injury, or death, can send the message \"I don’t have the ability to keep myself safe\" or \"other people/things are only out to hurt me.\" You may take extra precautions to do everyday tasks or avoid any situation that may be risky at all like not leaving the house after 4pm so you're always home before dark. </li><li><b>Control:</b> Most people feel generally in control of their own life and what happens to them. Trauma can make you feel like life is out of your control, such as when natural disasters strike or other people's wreckless mistakes hurt you or your loved ones. You may start thinking \"no matter how hard I try, I'll never get what I need or want out of life\" or \"no matter what I do, people will treat me however they want or just leave.\" This may lead to strong emotional reactions and rash decisions in relationships, like breaking up with a dating partner the first time they tell you “no” or disagree with you. </li><li><b>Self-Esteem:</b> Some people may, without any trauma, struggle with low self-esteem, or feeling badly about themselves and their abilities. This can get worse when people believe they were at fault for traumatic events or were not strong enough, smart enough, or quick enough to prevent it from happening. These feelings can last years. It may also change the way you see other people, which is called \"other-esteem.\" If a traumatic event involved a perpetrator who mistreated you or violated your rights, you may have negative attitudes about people similar to the perpetrator, or just others generally: for example, \"all men want is to take sex and leave\" or \"everyone is just selfish and out for themselves.\" People whose self-esteem has been hurt because of trauma dismiss or \"explain away\" compliments, don't understand how others can see good qualities in them, and may struggle with feelings of depression. </li><li><b>Trust:</b> Trust toward yourself and others can change after trauma, especially if the event involved someone you knew, like an acquaintance or family member. You may not trust your judgment of others' character, perceptions of situations, or your decision-making. Often times, trust toward others may lead you to think you cannot trust other people under any circumstances. This could lead to avoiding new relationships, saying hurtful things to people in your family or social network who don’t deserve it, and doing extra tasks or work (walking to the supervision office rather than asking for a ride, paying rent for your roommates) because you are unwilling to test the trust of others and expect them to not follow through. </li><li><b> Power: </b> Similar to control, after trauma some people feel they are physically or mentally weak, or have no influence on how they do in school, at work, on probation, or at home. After traumatic events, thoughts may look like \"no one cares what I think, so why bother saying it\" and \"I don't have the skills or ability to change my direction on supervision.\" You may find yourself either giving up in areas where you feel you do not have any power <u><i>or</u></i> trying extra hard to regain power, such as by giving people ultimatums or acting aggressively in relationships. </li><li><b> Intimacy: </b> Intimacy is the experience of being close with someone, either emotionally or physically. It can include things like confiding in others, opening up about how you feel or think, or having sex with someone. Physical, sexual, or emotional abuse by a parent, sibling, spouse, or even stranger sends a clear message that intimacy in any form is dangerous and should be avoided. People who struggle with intimacy after trauma think things like \"I have to hide the real me because if she knew who I was, she would leave me\" or \"I don't think I could ever have sex with a trusting partner and enjoy it the way I should.\" Sometimes trauma can also lead people to use sex or romance as a coping mechanism, but often these relationships are not deep, genuine connections. </li></ul>",

Your negative thoughts, feelings, and behavior take place in these circles, you cannot avoid impacting others with your decisions. For example, if your trauma leads you to believe others cannot be trusted to follow through on their word, you may be unwilling to work on team projects or end up treating your coworkers poorly when they miss a deadline: <i>\"Of course you missed It! You're just as good as the rest of them. I don't know why I bother anymore.\" </i> Not only do these behaviors make the workplace uncomfortable for others, it will probably show up on your work evaluation the next time you want a promotion. <br> Negative impacts can happen at home with family, too. After trauma, some people believe others are only out to control or manipulate them, or that they cannot be honest with or confide in others. They may become stressed, angry, and withdraw from dating partners or their spouse when they start to feel they are no longer in control of the relationship. Their partner or spouse, confused and hurt, may behave in unhealthy ways or end the relationship. The children involved may learn mixed messages about what a healthy relationship looks like and grow up to have control issues of their own. The person who originally experienced the trauma is left feeling confused and abandoned, and is probably that much more convinced that they cannot get too close to people for fear of being hurt or left.",

For example, \"I'll <u>never</u> get a job to pay for my probation fees\" or \"My probation officer <u>always</u> writes me up for stupid mistakes.\" </li><li><b> Not using \"I\" statements</b>- \"I\" statements are used to help people focus on their own thoughts and feelings rather than on another person. When people don't focus on their own thoughts and feelings, they risk not taking responsibility for their own feelings and actions (an example of criminal thinking) or avoiding how they think and feel. For example, \"<u>You</u> ake me so made when <u>you</u> show up to my work unannounced\" rather than \"I feel embarrassed when you visit my work because I don't tell people I'm on community supervision\" or ”Because <u>my friends<u> wouldn’t just leave me alone, I got in trouble with my probation officer” rather than ”Because I did not tell my friends what contact was okay and not okay, I violated the terms of my probation agreement.”</li><li><b>Predicting the future</b>- These type of thoughts involve blaming other people or yourself for things that could not have been foreseen. When you expect others or yourself to know what will happen in the future, it takes away from your ability to truly examine the situation, who was actually responsible for events, who should feel guilty about the events, and how to avoid similar events in the future. For example, ”You should have known that the semi-truck would come into your lane like that!” or ”I can't believe I thought she would actually be sober this time around.” </li><li><b> Exaggerating OR minimizing</b>- These thoughts make the facts of the event MUCH worse (exaggerating) or better (minimizing) than what they actually were. Exaggerating and minimizing prevents people from being honest about their trauma and can make it easier to avoid working through it. For example, ”I mean, yeah, I told him I didn’t want to have sex with him but we were both drunk. It could have been so much worse” or ”You don't understand, I nearly died in that car accident. No, I didn't need medical attention, but you weren't there. You wouldn't know how horrible it was.” </li><li><b>Emotional reasoning </b>- These are thoughts that rely on emotions to determine if they are true. While emotions are important to think about and consider when talking about trauma, emotions do not always reflect the truth (especially for events that are scary or traumatic).

At her last meeting with her supervising officer, Antoinette was told that her court hearing to be released from supervision will be requested this week. Excitedly, Antoinette called her best friend Carlos to tell him the good news. Carlos answered the phone and listened to Antoinette, but seemed distracted. Suddenly, Antoinette heard Carlos shout ”what the fuck?! Shit!” Carlos could no longer be heard on the phone, and sounds of scraping metal and breaking glass were heard. Antoinette panicked, but had no idea what she could do to check on Carlos. Antoinette later found out that Carlos was talking to her while driving down the interstate, and was cut off by a semi-truck which then stopped suddenly. Carlos didn't react in time and rear-ended the semi-truck going 60 miles per hour. Carlos recovered from the accident a few weeks later, but Antoinette found herself feeling guilty about the pain Carlos went through, all because she called him on the phone. She tells herself that Carlos' accident is all her fault. Antoinette refuses to call people unless she knows for a fact that they are home and experiences a lot of anxiety when riding in the passenger seat of her friends' cars.</i>",

      "text": "The brain is programmed with different shortcuts so it can learn lots of information quickly. For example, when two things happen at the same time or close together in time, the brain may link those two things together. For some people in some situations, the process of connecting two things with each other can take a long time. However, for other people in other situations, it only takes one experience to associate two things with each other. Have you ever gotten sick after eating a certain food, like sushi or a cheeseburger? It was probably hard to eat that same food again after getting sick—all you can think of is the way it tasted coming back up! In a classic psychology experiment (which would not be allowed today) scientists gave a little boy a white rat to play with. As the boy was joyfully playing with the animal, someone made a loud, unpleasant noise behind him and it startled him. Eventually, with enough pairings of the rat and the terrible noise, ”little Albert” (as he was known) not only became scared of the white rat, but he was also scared of white bunnies and even Santa Claus’s beard because they reminded him of the scary loud noises. Now, there is plenty of research to show how harmful it is to create fear in people, and many treatments have been developed to reduce, and sometimes even eliminate, fear reactions and negative associations. Fear does not have to last forever. <br> These connections in your brain can also occur when a traumatic event happens. It could take just one time, or multiple times, for it to affect you. In many cases, something REALLY bad only needs to happen one time for your brain to connect details of the event (where it took place, what you smelled, what you saw, what you heard) with the feelings you had during the traumatic event (fear, anger, shock, sadness). Here’s an example: <br><i> Growing up, Yasmin’s mother used Smells So Fresh laundry detergent every week to wash her and her sibling’s clothes and bed sheets. Yasmin’s father was never in the picture, but her mom always had lots of male friends over to the house. She remembers witnessing her mother’s boyfriends smack her around. Sometimes they would hurl cruel insults at her mother and sometimes they would hit her, pull her hair, or firmly grab her arm. She remembers hiding in the laundry room when arguments between the adults in the house would break out. Yasmin is now 32 years old and lives on her own. Every time she smells the scent of Smells So Fresh detergent, she is rushed with feelings of terror, guilt, and anger. She normally avoids buying this brand herself, but one time she was at a neighbor’s house and caught a whiff of a blanket that draped over the neighbor’s couch. She immediately began to feel uneasy and irritable. Yasmin made up an excuse to leave the house and asked to catch up with her neighbor another day. She later realized the blanked smelled like Smells So Fresh. How did a laundry detergent have that much power over Yasmin? It’s because her brain learned a long time ago that the smell of the detergent meant someone was getting hurt or that she may be hurt. It was such a negative experience for Yasmin with such big consequences, that she still feels the effects today. The illustration below shows you this process. </i> ",

Your mental traffic light can help you figure out how serious your trauma reaction is and what you need to do to feel better and avoid hurting someone else. Here’s what to keep in mind when evaluating whether your reaction is green, yellow, or red. <br><ul><li><u><b> Green Trauma Reactions </u></b> - when you have emotions (sadness, anger) about your trauma, but you still feel in control of your thoughts and actions. When this happens, use coping skills you have learned in other modules, like Thought Stopping or Deep Breathing, to regain control of your emotions. </li><li><u><b> Yellow Trauma Reactions </u></b> - when you have strong emotions or impulses related to your trauma that are hard to fight, like the urge to shove someone who reminds you of your abuser. If you are thinking of ways to justify your behavior, such as ”he's talking the same way my abuser did, so he's probably a piece of shit anyways,” remember this is a form of criminal thinking and is a bad sign! Turn this behavior green by walking away from the situation and talking to someone who can help you. Leave the store, walk to the bus stop, call your supervising officer, or visit a friend. Then, use coping skills you have learned in other modules, like Thought Stopping and Cognitive Restructuring to calm yourself down and think about what caused your trauma reaction. </li><li> <u><b> Red Trauma Reaction </u></b> - when you have such intense or overwhelming thoughts and feelings related to your trauma that you lose track of what's happening around you, like flashbacks or reliving the event. For example, when someone drives down the highway and approaches the back of a tow truck, they suddenly visualize themselves smashing into the back of the truck like they did last winter. They suddenly see themselves in their old car and the road they were on at the time of the accident, not the road they are REALLY driving on right now. They've become immersed in a flashback, lost touch with reality, and are not only in great emotional distress, but in physical danger of another car wreck. To turn this Red Trauma Reaction green, the driver needs to stop what they’re doing and pull over to the side of the road. When you are in the red, leave the situation whenever possible and/or use coping skills to bring you back to the present moment, like Meditation and Grounding techniques. Then, call someone you trust, like your supervising officer or a family member, for support and comfort. Once you relax more, you can develop a plan to finish what you need to do and get back to a safe place, like home or to a doctor's appointment, where you can process what happened and get the help you need.",

But, you know better now. Abuse is not an excuse for abuse. This includes your own abuser(s). Retaliating with violence is not the answer; it will only get YOU in trouble. The only exception is self-defense—when you feel you are in immediate danger and must fight back. Otherwise, go through the appropriate channels to get justice for yourself. Treating others badly because of your own trauma is likely to give them their own trauma to work through. In this way, trauma becomes one vicious, painful cycle.

Ask yourself what the benefits are to acting on your impulses, and what are the benefits to not acting?

Survivor’s guilt looks something like this: ”Why was I spared but others weren’t? Why do I deserve to live?” What someone wore during a trauma doesn’t matter and we will never know why some people leave this world earlier than others. Because something bad happened to you, you are a victim by definition. Nothing can change what happened in the past or why you’re still sitting here today. But, what you call yourself matters.<br> Seeing yourself as a victim does not have to be the only way to describe yourself for the rest of your life! In fact, victims have a RESPONSIBILITY to themselves to work through their trauma <i>and grow from their experiences, no matter how negative</i>. This is especially true when your attitudes and behavior impact your relationships with other people or your ability to complete supervision. ",

Before Oji realized he needed to create a different world, he explored other worlds to see where he fit best. During that time, he witnessed terrible events—war, starvation, and emptiness. Seeing such awful conditions that his fellow beings lived in kept him awake at night, tossing and turning. He was so upset at the thought of others’ suffering, he started going crazy with worry. When he developed into a supernatural being, Oji had a choice to make: do I continue worrying about other people and creatures who are unhappy, or do I act? Considering Oji’s beautiful world of mountains, grassy plains, and peaceful waters, you can imagine which option he chose! <br> Though you aren’t supernatural, you have powers within yourself. In the same way Oji chose to make a better life for other living things and himself, you can choose to tell your story in a way that makes you feel more empowered. For example, instead of thinking of yourself as a victim, think of yourself as a survivor. Being a survivor doesn’t mean that what happened to you is okay or right. It just puts the spotlight on your successes, what you did well, and how you are making a better life for yourself. You survived and persevered. You didn’t lay down and die. There is nothing wrong with being a victim—but lots of progress comes from being a survivor. Survivors find healthy ways to learn from their experiences and carry on. "

When you restory a story, the key facts—the who, what, when, and where—stay the same. But the way the victim is described changes. You can describe what they did to overcome the attacker or the disaster. You can make them sound like a hero! Let’s try to restory Joetta’s story. <br> ”Joetta was 15 years old when Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana. The hurricane caused the water levels to rise, which forced the levies, or dams, holding back water to break. As a result, Joetta’s house flooded. Water rushed in through the windows and doors of Joetta’s home at an unbelievable speed. Joetta fled her house with her dad. When she looked around, she realized her mom and brother had not fled with them. Joetta screamed for them to come out of the house. Joetta’s dad went back into the house to look for them. She stood on the sidewalk crying for what seemed like forever. Eventually Joetta’s dad came out of the house again, carrying her little brother’s lifeless body. Joetta’s mom walked out after him, then fell to the ground and screamed. It felt like time stopped for Joetta—she couldn’t do anything except stare at her dead brother. Her ears were ringing. She could hear her mom’s screams only vaguely. Now, at the age of 30 years old, Joetta still thinks back on that day. She can hear the screaming like it was yesterday, and sees realistic images of how her brother looked that day. She has dreams that include drowning, waking up in her childhood bed to the sound of rushing water, and that her brother’s dead body will wash up inside her house, staring at her, bumping against her feet. Joetta will start to cry uncontrollably when she thinks about that day, and whenever someone talks about flooding or hurricanes happening in other states, she tells people that she lost everything to Hurricane Katrina—including her family.”",

The trauma may be upsetting or troublesome, but they are still able to go to work or school and take care of themselves. Other people who experience trauma have difficulty going to work, school, the store, or taking care of themselves each day because of the stress and despair that their trauma caused them. This ”next-level” trauma response can also cause people to experience some or all of the following: <ul><li> Vivid flashbacks that are like reliving the experience. </li><li> Feeling disconnect from yourself, like an outer-body experience, or being in slow motion (this is often called dissociation). </li><li> Thoughts that you, your thoughts, or your emotions aren't real. </li><li> Thoughts that your life or the world isn't real. </li><li> Seeing, hearing, or feeling things that remind you of the trauma make you really angry, nervous, or upset. </li><li> Thoughts of harming yourself or other people. </li><li> Constantly checking your surroundings or feeling paranoid the trauma could happen again at any moment. </li></ul><br> The symptoms that come with next-level trauma make it hard to complete community supervision because you may avoid leaving your house, finding a job, or meeting with your supervising officer. When next-level trauma symptoms are triggered, it can be hard to keep your cool, especially in public places. Trauma symptoms can cause people to act out in a verbally or physically aggressive way. Other people may see you as someone who is angry, yelling, or possibly threatening violence when you are really just hurting and don’t know how to stop the trauma reminders. In extreme cases, you may hurt someone accidentally or without realizing it, which jeopardizes your probation. If your probation officer or counselor don’t know you’ve experienced a trauma and that symptoms related to that trauma are concerns for you, they will not know how to help you if something happens in the future. This is why is it important to at least remind your officer that you are working on this module.

Do not diagnose yourself based on the information in this module or anything you may read on the internet.
