You may be currently looking for a job or already have one. Depending on where you are in the job hunt or how satisfied you are with your work, the focus of this module may be more about helping you keep what you have or even move up the chain. If you don’t have a job yet or aren’t satisfied with your work, this module may give you some tools to make needed changes.",

As unfair as it may be, employers feel nervous about hiring people who have been in trouble with the law. This means you will have to dig a little deeper to find a job, be more patient and persistent (don’t get sidetracked by rejection), and work harder to make a good first impression. You may even need to compromise on what types of jobs you’re willing to do. In other words, some job opportunities may seem “below” you, but you need to start somewhere. That doesn’t mean you needto stay in this job forever, but you may need to start lower and work your way back up. Plus, you are required to be employed as part of your supervision rules. Don’t pass up a job simply because it’s not your dream job. In this worksheet, we will focus on getting your mind ready to start looking for a job so you can improve your success of finding and keeping one.",

Researchers have found that certain attitudes and ways of thinking about work make people more or less likely to be happy in their jobs and stay in their jobs. People who see their jobs as part of who they are as a person (work is an aspect of their identity), are more successful in their jobs and report greater enjoyment at work. These people think things like: <ul><li><b> Work should be considered central to life </li><li> I would probably keep working even if I didn't need the money </li><li> Overall, I consider work to be very central to my existence </b></li></ul> On the other hand, people who seek work only as a means to an end (for example, to make money) or are cynical about work are less successful and happy in their jobs. These people think things like: <ul><li><b> No matter how hard you work, you never really seem to reach your goals </li><li> Ordinary work is too boring to be worth doing </li><li> I don't enjoy work; I just put in my time to get paid </b></li></ul> People are also more likely to get a good job they like (or can at least tolerate) if they're confident in themselves, feel in control during the hiring process, and can make compromises when necessary. These people think things like: <b><ul><li> I feel in control over my job choices </li><li> I've learned how to find my own way through the world of work </li><li> In order to provide for my family, I may have to take a job I don't enjoy as much </b></li></ul> There have even been a handful of studies on work attitudes among people on community supervision. One study found that those who ended up violating terms of their supervision had more negative views toward work in general and showed more entitlement toward employment opportunities, such as refusing to take lower-end jobs and work toward promotions, than those who successfully completed their supervision sentence.

Interests are useful, but they must be considered along with your skills and education, or your ability to obtain the necessary skills and education.

And, once people have a bad impression of you, it’s hard to change their mind. Researchers have done studies on first impressions and have shown this to be true. Often, first impressions are based on your appearance and body language. While that isn’t fair, it is fact. What do you need to do to make a good first impression with employers? Here’s another checklist of what helps. <ul><li><b>Be on time for your interview</b>—leave extra early in case the bus is late, you get lost, there's unexpected traffic, or you can't find parking. Employers don't like excuses. </li><li><b> Wear appropriate clothes</b> —don't wear anything that has holes in it, is too low-cut or too short, is too colorful, or smells gross. If you don't have anything in your closet, borrow something! Try the local Goodwill or Dress for Success. Make sure it fits you before you buy it. </li><li><b>Have a bright smile</b>—no one likes when they're told to smile, but smiling makes people feel comfortable and happy to be around you. This is important especially if the job involves customer service. But don't go overboard; people who take this too far can seem fake. </li><li><b>Keep an open and confident presence</b>—don't cross your arms, sit up straight, walk tall, keep good eye-contact (not too much or too little), and use a firm hand shake when first introducing yourself; you want to look inviting and like you deserve to be there. </li><li><b>Use small talk</b>—you learned about this in the last module. Comment on the weather or the \"big game\" last week. Find out if you have anything in common with the employer. Don't talk about religion or politics. </li><li><b>Be attentive</b>—limit distractions like your phone...don't check your phone or text during an interview! Don't bring food, shopping bags, or your kids. And spit out that gum. </li><li><b>Be the best version of yourself</b>—you don't have to completely change who you are; you're just putting your best foot forward to earn trust, respect, and confidence</li></ul><br> Even if something in the interview pisses you off—like someone making a rude comment about your criminal history—stick with a positive attitude anyway. You can always say \"no\" to them later, but you don't want them being the ones slamming the door on you. Be the better person. ",

      "text": "When you are asked about your criminal history in an interview, you have to answer honestly. Remember, an employer can decide not to hire you, or to fire you later, if you lie on this question. But you can choose what to tell them. This is your first piece of armor, your helmet. <ul><li><b>Helmet—using your head</b>: Protect the things that are most important to you: your dignity, your privacy, and your right to being respected. When an employer asks you about your criminal history, only tell them what they need to know: whether you were arrested or convicted, what for (a general description, such as theft or substance use), and any important details about what happened that might make you look better to your future employer (<i>\"it was only once when I was young\"</i> or <i>\"I was there when someone else got in trouble, so I was guilty by association\"</i>). But only IF THESE THINGS ARE TRUE. Use what makes the most sense for your situation. Don't spend much time on this question — one to two sentences, at most. You also don't want to air your dirty laundry about the judge who screwed you over or the drug dealer who snitched on you. Short and simple is the key here! Stay smart. </li><li><b> Sword—your best weapon</b>: A sword is the sharpest weapon you could have — in your case, your sharpest weapon is what you learned from your experience in the system. Think about what you learned about life, mortality, being an adult, or responsibility while in prison or while on community supervision. Tie some of these life lessons into the interview questions. If you offense was stealing, talk about the lessons you learned in integrity, honesty, and how criminal acts affect the entire community. If your offense was something violent, say what you learned about yourself, how you've grown as a person, gotten the help you needed, and the value of respecting others. Then say a few words on what you are doing to move forward in life, such as finding a job and working with authorities to better your life. It is your opportunity to show the interviewer your personal growth and what you want your life to look like moving forward. However, be selective. Don't make everything about prison or your crime and keep it to the point. </li><li><b>Shield—holding your own</b>: The last important piece of armor is your shield. Your shield guards you from things that may hurt your chance at getting the job you are interviewing for. Your shield is positive thinking, your personal strengths, and your goals. Sometimes, employers ask questions that can make us feel negative or put doubt in our minds, such as \"Do you think you can perform the job duties given your criminal background?\" These questions can surprise us if we are not ready for them. Luckily, you have your shield to help you deflect the negativity using positive thinking. If you used positive thinking, your response to that question could be \"Yes, I do. In fact, I feel that my criminal background has helped prepare me to perform the job duties. I am a better person than I was before, I follow rules and respect authority. Plus, I have learned new skills like how to be a good leader and the importance of being a reliable employee.\" Answer these hard-hitting questions by not getting upset or criticizing the interviewer, not talking about other negative things, and telling the interviewer the things you do well. </li></ul>  ",

In some states, a person’s arrest record can change a hiring decision if the arrest is recent, if it is likely that you did it, and if the arrest is similar to what you would be doing in a job.So, if you were recently arrested for stealing your girlfriend’s car, and you are applying to work as a car valet driver, they may have some questions to ask and may hesitate to offer you the job. In most states, employers can ask about your arrest history during an interview. <br> Similarly, employers have the right to request a criminal background check and see if you have been convicted of any crimes before they employ you. This background check includes any offense that you have been convicted of, including traffic violations. If you were arrested for something but were never convicted of that offense, it will not show up on your criminal background check. <br> In some cases, your criminal background could prevent you from getting a certain type of job. For example, if you have a felony on your record, you are not allowed to have access to firearms. This would prevent you from working as a police officer or a security guard. It can also prevent you from working at banks or in positions where you have access to vulnerable people, such as children or the elderly. <br> This fact can be pretty disappointing. You and your supervising officer both know that you are trying to turn your life around and that you are a good person. You would not take advantage of your privileges in these position, but in the past people have. When people who have criminal records take advantage of their jobs and hurt people or steal, they spoil the opportunity for everyone else to find good jobs. Employers have to pay a lot of money and fix a lot of things when those kinds of things happen. It makes hiring people with criminal backgrounds in the future seem risky.  ",

In some states, employers cannot ask about arrest history at all. A few states have passed laws making it illegal to ask about convictions on a job application, a social movement called “Ban the Box,” but this is still a new idea –so check your local laws before you accuse your potential employer of discriminating against offenders on their application! <br> We’ve also talked about some of the things that employers can do: ask questions about arrest history or convictions during an interview, choose not to hire you because you have been arrested 1) recently, 2) in connection to a crime you likely committed, or 3) in connection to a crime that is related to the job you are applying for; choose not to hire you because you have a conviction that directly prevents you from working in that job (can’t possess a firearm, work with children, etc.). Employers can also choose not to hire you, or to even fire you, if you are asked about your criminal history on an application or during an interview and lied in your answers. <br> If you finish an interview and realize your interviewer said or did something that goes against these rules, or they gave you a hiring decision and you feel like it was not within legal guidelines, there are a few things <i>you</i> need to do. The first thing to do is to <i>pause</i>. Think about what you are feeling and thinking. Are you angry that someone would discriminate against you? Are you sad that you didn’t get that job you were hoping for? Take note.<i> Don’t react</i>. It can be easy to call the employer an asshole for not hiring you, or even punching the window of the business as you walk out. These actions will make it even harder for you to get understanding and help in making a discrimination case, and it will just confirm the employer’s judgment: that people with convictions or arrests are dangerous and can’t be trusted. <br>  Second, you want to ask someone you trust for their opinion on the situation. Talk to your community supervision officer, your counselor, and maybe an employee at the state department about what you experienced. Before you conclude that they discriminated against you, ask other people if they feel like you were discriminated against. Ask them to help you research your state’s hiring laws to confirm the rules in your area, as each state, and even city, is different. <br> If you and trusted others feel that you have been discriminated against, you can talk to your community supervising officer or counselor about obtaining legal resources to help you pursue the claim further.
