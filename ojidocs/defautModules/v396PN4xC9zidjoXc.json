According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics—a government agency that collects data on people in the criminal justice system—about 4.6 million people are being supervised by community corrections departments like the one you report to. If you aren’t new to supervision, some of the information in this section will be a no-brainer (duh!).

It can help release tension, control other people and get what you want, or trigger positive actions (consider people who protest in Washington D.C. to make changes to our laws or economy). But, many of these apparent payoffs can have serious long-term consequences. Read the below story about dealing with anger: <i> Now, imagine that you are in a tug-of-war with a huge, ugly anger monster. You have one end of the rope and the monster has the other end. In between the two of you is a dark, bottomless pit. If you fall in, you will die. You’re pulling and fighting as hard as you can, but the monster keeps pulling you closer and closer to certain doom. What’s the best thing you can do in this situation? Your first guess might be to pull even harder. That’s the natural choice. But, the monster will also pull harder. What’s another option? Drop the rope. When you drop the rope, the monster is still there, but you’re no longer mixed up in a struggle with him. Your body and mind are free to do something more helpful for solving your challenges. </i> <br> Just like in the story, if you keep fighting with your feelings of anger, you are not only going to become physically tired, but you’re also putting yourself at risk of getting into trouble. For example, uncontrolled anger could lead you to violate your supervision or avoid activities, and in turn, add time to your sentence or a trip back to prison. Acceptance, on the other hand, means opening up and acknowledging your feelings. This is what happens when you give up the fight. By doing this, you can make room for anger-related emotions, urges, and sensations while also having the energy to focus on what you need to do to complete your sentence without further struggles. In other words, you can realize that anger is a normal response to a frustrating situation without letting your anger take over and stop you from accomplishing your goals. DON’T LET THAT ANGER MONSTER PULL YOU DOWN. We will revisit anger again in more detail later in the program.",

The calendar allows you to label events as a supervision task, a work task, or a leisure task and to set the priority level (high, medium, low). Supervision tasks are those directly related to your community supervision; work tasks are related to your job or home; leisure tasks are social or “for fun” activities that help you relax and stay happy. Planning “me time” and pro-social activities is just as important as planning supervision appointments. By sorting activities this way, you can better prioritize. Below are some examples of each: <ul><li><b>Supervision:</b> Check-in, home visit, complete change of address form, attend AA/NA meeting</li><li><b>Work/Home:</b>Job interview, submit report to boss, pick up groceries, pay rent</li><li><b>Leisure:</b> Movie night with the kids, intramural football game, church bake sale, outlet shopping </li></ul>",

Believe it or not, supervision officers and counselors notice the people who are doing well. It may feel like they don’t notice you as much because they spend less time with you, but that’s exactly how they notice your success! They don’t have extra paperwork or meetings related to you breaking the rules, which goes a long way. For some community supervision departments, there are even rewards for following the rules and doing well. When your supervising officer is able to give examples of your good and compliant behavior, you are more likely to earn additional resources and good favor from the judge overseeing your case. You want them to be on your side because their decisions directly impact you and your sentence, but you have to give them clear reasons to help and support you. Not to mention, being in good favor means you avoid negative consequences like fines, being revoked, or time added, which can lead to time away from your family, lost wages, and your freedom.",

      "text": "Researchers have shown that unplanned leisure time (leisure time is your free time to do things of your choosing; it does not include work or other required tasks such as school or household chores) is a risk factor for returning to criminal behavior. In other words, people who are on community supervision and do not learn to plan out or schedule leisure activities are likely to occupy their time with activities that could get them in trouble with the law again. Doing activities that you enjoy is important for your health, but you must use that time wisely! Pro-social activities are helpful for keeping you occupied and out of trouble. If you are already engaged in a positive activity, it is much easier to say “no” when an opportunity to violate the rules comes along. In addition, your mind and body will grow stronger if you participate in activities regularly and in ways that are consistent with your goals. Let’s look at an example: <i>\"Billy used to sit in his house watching television most of the day, only leaving to go to work and visit his officer once a month. Over time, he started to feel tired. He spent a lot of time thinking about his life before community supervision. His muscles felt weak, he began to forget things easily, and he even thought about suicide. His counselor recommended that he take advantage of free memberships at the local library. Billy selected a book about meditation that helped him to relax. At first, it was difficult for him to read again; he had to sound the words out loud to himself and it took him a while to finish the book. But soon, his reading and comprehension skills increased, and Billy was completing most books in no time. He liked how some of the books taught him new things, while other books allowed him to escape his world for a little while and dive into the world of the characters in the story. Billy was also careful in his book choices – he did not read books about violence or crime because he knew they might trigger bad behavior. He read books that were interesting, but ones that carried a positive message. He also liked being in the library around other people who shared his interests. Sometimes he attended community events at the library, like movie night or poetry readings. He even met a few friends there and the staff know his name. Billy also discovered that he could use the computers there to find other events going on in his neighborhood.\"</i>",

The amount of sleep you get and how well you sleep each night can be complicated by your mood/emotions, being in a new place (sleeping in your bedroom after sleeping in jail, for example) or noise from the city streets and the feeling that someone is always watching you. Over time, your mind and body will start to get used to all this stuff. It’s also important to know that some types of medication cause poor sleep as a side effect; you may want to ask if this is true for any of the medications you are taking. Sleep disturbances can lead to emotional and physical struggles, such as anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue, and poor memory and concentration. Your brain and body need good, quality sleep to be healthy and to function properly. In fact, if you go too long without sleep, your mind can start to play tricks on you – you may even see or hear things that aren’t really there. Good sleep and a regular sleep schedule can also help you stay organized!",

Here are a few tips to start with: <ul><li><b> Don't nap during the day </b> - it's tempting to sleep all day when there isn't a lot to do, but don't forget about your Activity Log! Sleeping during the day makes your brain feel like it doesn't need to rest at night.</li><li><b>Try exercising<b> - physical activity gives your body a reason to energize, which is what sleep does. But, do not exercise too close to bedtime or you will feel hyperactive. </li><li><b>Manage stress </b> - stress causes worry and racing thoughts, which can keep you up at night. Before you go to bed, write down what's on your mind to get it out of your head. Even thinking of a funny joke can relax you. </li><li><b>Stick to a sleep schedule</b> - try to go to bed and get up at the same time everyday. Being consistent helps your mind and body learn when to shut off each night.</li><li><b>Create a bedtime ritual or routine</b> - again, doing the same things at night lets your mind and body know when it's time to wind down. This could include reading a book, doodling a picture, writing down what's on your mind, quietly humming a song, stretching your muscles, or doing deep breathing exercises. </li><li><b>Use imagery</b> - when you close your eyes, think of something comforting, like a pleasant memory. Imagine that you are somewhere else, and that the noises you hear belong to something else. Immersing yourself in a relaxing mental story is like starting your own dream. </li></ul>",

Allow yourself about 20-30 minutes before going to bed to complete the exercise. And make sure it is the LAST thing you do before going to sleep. Read ALL the instructions first so you have an idea how to do it and can focus more of your attention on relaxing. When you read the steps to yourself, talk in a slow, soothing voice. <b> Sit upright on your bed or in a chair with your legs hanging over the edge.</b> 1. Arms <ul><li> Clasp both hands into fists and roll your wrist with your knuckles pointing upward. Hold the tightness for 10 seconds and notice the tension in your muscles. Now let go of the tightness and let your arms relax onto the bed/chair. Notice the change in how your muscles feel. Repeat by making fists again for 10 seconds and then relaxing for 20 seconds (be sure to count quietly to yourself)</li><li> Next, bend both your elbows and flex your biceps like a body-builder. Hold this pose for 10 seconds then let go of the tension for 20 seconds. Repeat. </li><li> Now, lock your elbows straight and stretch your arms toward the floor. Feel the tension up and down your arms. Release after 10 seconds and relax for 20 seconds. Repeat. </li></ul> 2. Legs <ul><li> Flex your toes by bringing them toward your head while you tighten your shin and calf muscles. Hold for 10 seconds then release for 20 seconds by letting your feet hang loosely. Repeat. </li><li> Tighten your lower legs while pointing your toes outward. Hold the position for 10 seconds then return your toes to their natural place for 20 seconds. Repeat. </li><li> Tense your inner thigh muscles by pressing your knees together as hard as you can without causing pain for 10 seconds. Release and feel the sense of ease spread throughout your legs. Repeat. </li><li>Tighten your buttocks and thighs. Increase the tension by straightening your legs and pushing down hard through your heels. Hold this position for 10 seconds then let go. Repeat. </li></ul> 3. Mid-section <ul><li> Gently arch your back. Hold the tension for 10 seconds, then relax by letting your back be flat against the wall or chair. Repeat. </li><li>Take a deep breath and fill your lungs with air. Tighten all the muscles in your chest and abs. Hold your breath, then breathe out and release the air. Repeat. </li><li>Stretch your shoulders backward as though you were trying to touch your ears. Hold for 10 seconds then let your shoulders droop toward the floor. Repeat. </li></ul> 4. Head <ul><li>Tilt your head backward and stretch your chin toward the ceiling. Hold for 10 seconds then release and bring your chin to rest on your chest. Repeat.</li><li>Clench your jaw and push your tongue up to the roof of your mouth. Hold then release. Notice the relaxation of your lips. Repeat. </li><li>Close your eyes tightly and smile, stretching your mouth as wide as you can. Hold it for 10 seconds then relax. Repeat. </li><li> Raise your eyebrows as high as you can and feel the tension across the top of your head. Hold, then relax. Repeat. </li></ul> Repeat these steps as many times as you want, then slowly lower your body down into your bed and place your head gently on the pillow. Close your eyes. ",
