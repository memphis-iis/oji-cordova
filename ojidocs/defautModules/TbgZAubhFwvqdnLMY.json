This module will help you recognize your triggers for aggression and impulsivity and guide you through specific methods to deal with emotions that can be hard to manage.",

      "text": "After being in jail or prison, you must feel like you’ve seen, or even used, aggressive behaviors a lot recently. Inmates act out for a number of reasons, such as expressing an emotion (anger, fear, anxiety), seeking revenge, getting something they want, or feeling powerful. Now that you are out of jail or prison and under community supervision, you may have the same feelings. Acting aggressively can have immediate benefits, but those benefits are neverworth the serious consequences. Violence is a poor way to handle problems, but, if youdo not learn better ways, youwill resort to what youknow. Violent behavior can be influenced by the environment – your family, friends, neighborhood, or being in prisonat some point. Many people learn how to think, act, and feel from their parents or caregivers during childhood. For example, children whose parents hugged them and expressed their feelings are likely to be warm and affectionate adults. Other types of family experiences encourage aggression and violence that can carry over into adulthood.",

Aggression can also be a symptom or side effect of brain damage, medications you may be taking, or mental illness. BUT THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE. In other words, these factors do not give you the right to abuse, violate, harm, or offend another person. You are now responsible for learning more productive ways of expressing your anger, frustration, and other upsetting emotions without being physically, verbally, or sexually violent.

Things that are inherited cannot be changed; you either have it or you don't. You CAN change your actions. </li><li><b> Anger Always Leads to Aggression </b> - You might think this is true if the only way you know how to express anger is through aggression. But, there are better and healthier ways of dealing with anger. For example, you can learn to control the escalation of anger by using relaxation techniques (like PMR), changing negative and hostile thoughts, and practicing assertiveness skills (coming up later in this program). </li><li><b> The Only Way to Get What you Want is to Be Aggressive </b> - Wrong again. A better way to get what you want is to be assertive, not aggressive. The goal of aggression is to intimidate, dominate, show power, injure, or harm another person. But, the goal of assertiveness is to express anger while also being respectful of others. Being assertive does not mean blaming or bullying other people; you can get what you want without causing physical or emotional harm. This IS possible. You will learn how to be assertive in another activity. </li><li><b> Venting Anger is Always Helpful </b> - Many people used to believe that screaming into or beating on pillows, smashing objects, or pounding a punching bag were healthy ways of blowing off steam. Now, researchers know that people who vent their anger aggressively, even if they are not harming another person, just get better at being angry. That is, when you vent your anger in this way, all you're doing is encouraging more aggression. It feels good to vent, so you come to learn that it feels good to be aggressive. </li></ul> ",

Many people confuse anger and aggression (see the \"Anger Always Leads to Aggression\" myth on the previous page). Aggression is meant to cause harm or injury to a person or their belongings. Anger can be handled in ways that do not get you into trouble and are not dangerous to others. The diagram below shows how anger can turn into aggression. The escalation phase is the beginning of the cycle –this is where you see the first signs of anger. If you allow theescalation phase tocontinue, you will soon lose control. Uncontrollable anger leads to verbal and physical aggression – this is the explosion phase. The anger episode eventually ends, and there are negative consequences – this is the post-explosion phase.",

Others have a habit of brushing their teeth before bedtime. Still others have a habit of smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, or using drugs. Anger that is expressed often and aggressively can become a habit, too. You can break this habit by making changes to how you think or interpret situations, how you act, where you go, and who you hang around. But, remember, change is hard. It took Oji a really long time to make his changes, and he’s a supernatural being! Think about how difficult it is for people to quit smoking or stay sober. Be prepared to work for it.

You see a shark in the waters ahead. All you have to do is take a few steps back, and you are onshore. Now, imagine being further out and spotting the shark. Instead of just a few steps, you have to move your arms and legs harder, battling the waves and currents to get out. The deeper you are, the harder it is to get back to shore safely. Similarly, the longer you let your anger go on, the more difficult it will be to calm yourself down. So, focus on preventing escalation of anger so it doesn’t becomean explosion of anger.

      "text": "As you read, anger can be triggered by certain events in your life, but it’s really about how your mind understands or explains these events to you that takes you to the explosion phase –the point where you experience aggression or an outburst of anger. In other words, how you think about an event may cause you to behave in ways that are against your goals. One method for stopping anger before it gets the best of you is to challenge or dispute the thoughts your mind comes up with. This method is called Cognitive Restructuring. “Cognitive” is another word to explain the things that go on in your mind. “Restructuring” is a word that means you are going to change something about what goes on in your mind. So, cognitive restructuring is one way you could change your thoughts about an anger-triggering event. The idea is to replace your negative thoughts with thoughts that are more helpful and tell a better story of the situation. Here's an example: <i>\"Tony has been working at a fast food restaurant as a cook for about 6 months now. Another cook, Jeff, is new to the kitchen and doesn’t know his way around just yet. The crew is preparing food for the lunch rush that day. Tony asks Jeff to make the restaurant’s signature sauce. Jeff doesn’t know what he’s doing, so he asks Tony where the bowls are...then, he asks for the ingredients...then, he needs to know how much salt to use. Tony is frustrated that Jeff is being such a pain in the ass and thinks that he might as well make everything himself! Then, just as Tony begins to walk away to prepare another food dish, Jeff splashes Tony with the sauce while mixing everything together. That’s it! Tony turns around, shoves Jeff and yells “What the fuck, man?! Can’t you do ANYTHING right??” Jeff pushes back at Tony, and, before you know it, the two of them are in a physical fight. The lunch shift supervisor shows up, and both men get suspended from their jobs. The supervisor called the police to diffuse the situation. Tony has to explain his incident of police contact to his community supervisor.\"</i>",

      "text": "As you know, one apparent benefit of aggression and violence is getting control over others or getting what you want from others. Aggression can also be used to solve problems or deal with conflicts between people. When you feel that someone has violated your rights or well-being, your first reaction might be to fight back or retaliate. You want revenge. Aggression sends the message that “my feelings, thoughts, and opinions are very important, but your feelings, thoughts, and opinions are not important.” People don’t like to feel less-than or worthless. So, a few consequences of aggression may include losing close relationships or putting yourself at risk for a physical altercation. But there is a better way to express your feelings and still get what you want... without hurting others or getting yourself in trouble. The opposite of acting aggressively is to act passively. Being passive isn’t helpful either. By acting in a passive way, you allow others to violate your rights and take advantage of you. You’re a doormat for people to walk on. You may come to despise the person who is violating your rights or be upset with yourself for not standing for your rights. Passivity sends the message that “your feelings, thoughts, and opinions are very important, but my feelings, thoughts, and opinions are not important.” People who are passive generally do not feel good about themselves. They may have low self-esteem and feel inferior to other people. They are also likely to be disrespected and treated unfairly by others. The BEST way to resolve conflicts with other people or to express your negative feelings (like anger, frustration, sadness, pain) is by acting assertively. Assertiveness involves standing up for your rights while also showing respect for other people. Assertive behavior sends the message that “my feelings, thoughts, and opinions are just as important as your feelings, thoughts, and opinions.” It’s ok...and even normal...for people to disagree with you. That doesn’t mean their beliefs are more important or less important. You can still be respectful. Assertiveness allows you to share your feelings and reactions to the person who offended or hurt you without suffering the negative consequence of aggression or passivity.",

Remember, they are stuck in a negative cycle that keeps them in trouble, and they want you to be stuck with them. Believe it or not, Oji was not the first being to complete a journey and grow into a new person that could accomplish great things. There was a supernatural being before him, and he had many expectations for Oji. He made Oji feel like he couldn’t feel bad about his journey, no matter how hard it got, and that he always had to “tough it out” by himself. No matter how hard Oji tried to ignore his feelings, he couldn’t hold them back –and the harder he tried to hold his feelings back, the longer his journey became. Oji eventually realized that when he lets himself feel his emotions and deal with them assertively, that his journey went better than before! He did not have to “be tough” like the supernatural being before him to reach his goal. Aggressive anger may seem like the manly or tough thing to do because it shows power and control. It’s common for people who have been to jail or prison to feel powerful, tough, and in control, for both men and women. But, the truth is, anger is the easy way out. It’s easier to let anger escalate and to bully people into getting what you want than it is to manage your anger and to solve your problems pro-socially. You may scare and intimidate other people, but they don’t see you as superior, like you would want them to. Even though your victims may step aside when you walk in the room, they do not see you as the better person. Instead, they see you as an asshole who is out of control, crazy, and irresponsible. You do not gain respect this way –at least not from the people who matter. You may be respected by other violent peopleor gang members but remember where they are and where you don’t want to be. Aggression is cowardly and lazy –it doesn’t require any real work to get things, and the things you do get are shallow and not meaningful. Tough peoplearen’t lazy. They work hard for what’s important, even if it means they have to think and act in ways that are challenging or uncomfortable. Tough peoplewill push through and make it happen.",

But, the reality is you are living in a societywhere many peopledo not know or do not practice this skill.

So, when you try to be assertive,they may not respond well. They may yell at you, call you names, tell you to “fuck off,” or threaten to harm you. Understand that this is THEIR problem. They are being lazy and feel more comfortable handling problems the only way they know how –through aggression. They wrongly believe that being tough means bullying others. Don’t get upset by these people, it will only make you lose sight of your goals. You are stronger and capable of controlling your anger. You are responsible for successfully completingyourcommunity supervision,so younever need it again. When other people resist your attempts to be assertive and to solve the problem peacefully, you may just need to walk away. It’s not worth the fight. Tell yourself it is their loss.

People who are passive-aggressive are more likely to get more restrictions on their community supervision. So, it’s another important behavior to learn about and get control over. People who are uncomfortable being openly aggressive will often use passive- aggression to get what they want by indirectly saying or doing something that makes others feel bad, guilty, embarrassed, or ashamed. It allows people to have things their way and still be liked. Passive-aggression is sneaky; instead of being verbally abusive or physically assaultive, you are hiding your aggression under a sly comment or behavior. Passive-aggression doesn’t always appear as angry or resentful. It can sometimes sound polite, friendly, or well-meaning. Sometimes people don’t realize they’ve been victims of passive-aggression until later. But, the more you behave this way, the more people will see the truth – that you are using this strategy to manipulate them or your situation. Community supervisors knows this behavior well and see it as a reason for disciplinary action. To them, you are showing non-compliance and an overall bad attitude. Just because you are not verbally threatening or physically hurting someone doesn’t mean you aren’t causing harm. Here's an example:",

Just like an iceberg, anger is on the surface. It’s what other people can see, and it only shows a small part of the problem. All those other emotions are hiding beneath the surface. That’s where the danger lies – <u>IF</u> you don’t watch out for them. But, knowing that there is more to anger than meets the eye, you can begin to focus on these other emotions. Understanding what your anger is covering up will help you get to the real root of the problem so you can start to come up with solutions that work. By doing this, you will feel less angry and act less aggressively. ",

It’s scary having so many rules to follow while being back on the outside, with more freedom and more temptations to make bad choices.Fear may even be a reason why it’s hard to follow the rules of community supervision: you are expected to work with new people, participate in new things like educational classes, counseling, and maybe even regular drug testing. Fear is often expressed as anger because, on the streets, people who look scared become victims of bullying and violence.
