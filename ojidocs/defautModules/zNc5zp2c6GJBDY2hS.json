He asks his brother to help him practice interviewing for jobs – making eye contact, shaking hands, and answering questions. Blake uses money from his savings to buy some nice clothes, so he can make a good impression at his interviews. He soon gets an interview for a job as a maintenance worker at an apartment complex. Blake’s friend, Jake, lives in the same complex. So, he asks Jake to tell him more about the complex – what the residents like and dislike about living there. This information helps Blake play up his strengths (what he can add to the job). Before his interview, he also writes down questions he wants to ask so he’ll be better prepared.
