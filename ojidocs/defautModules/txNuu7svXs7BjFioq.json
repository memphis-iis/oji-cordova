  "description": "We like to think we are free from the influence of others, but the way we think, how we act, and what we value is often a reflection of those around us. This module talks about the role other people play in your life. They can either help or hinder your goals. You will learn how to move away from the people who bring you down, including family or close friends, and toward people who lift you up. Remember, sometimes love and support means holding you accountable table-dark!",

      "text": "Remember THE Circle of Change? Part of that circle was your environment. And, part of your environment is the people you are around. Review the diagram in the box below: <br> We like to think that we are our own person; that we can make our own decisions and act without the influence of other people. But, this is not true. We often act a lot like the people we hang around. We share similar beliefs and do similar things. Imagine being at a neighborhood party where everyone is drinking beer, smoking, and having a great time. How would you feel going to that party and not drinking beer? You are likely to fee out of place, strange, awkward, or unwanted. So, you are more likely to drink and smoke, too. If you think other people do not or cannot impact how you think and act, you could be in trouble for relapse! Many people make the mistake of believing that they can say \"no\" when a yellow- or red-light event comes up without help (think back to your criminal thinking styles — is \"Superoptimism\" one of yours? If so, beware of this!). <br> Here's an example: <br> <i>\"Howie is 22 years old and this is his first time on probation. In his neighborhood growing up, he didn’t have many friends and kept to himself. Howie is smaller in size than a lot of the other guys on the block and he doesn’t talk very much. Growing up, he felt alone and scared. His fears got worse when other kids started bullying him and threatening to hurt him. Howie was even beat up in the school yard on several occasions by older boys. One time he suffered three broken ribs. This event was very embarrassing for Howie and he stopped going to school. When Howie should have been in 9th grade, his cousin Mitchell asked Howie if he wanted to make some \"fast cash\" and never be afraid of low-life punks again. He told Howie about this group of guys who could help protect him from danger. Mitchell said he just wanted to help Howie because they’re family. Everything was great at first. Howie could go to the basketball courts again because Mitchell and his buddies were always close by. And now, Howie had people to go to parties with and chill. He didn’t feel alone anymore, he felt safe. But, after a while, things started to change. Howie was doing drug runs for Mitchell and his crew but used some product for himself. To pay his debts, Howie started robbing houses and stores in nice neighborhoods for petty items. He was arrested one night after a shop clerk caught him with cigarettes and a bottle of gin tucked in his jacket. Now that Howie is on probation for these crimes, he’s been required to participant in treatment. He was talking to Mitchell about the new treatment program and Mitchell says, \"Man, you don't need that shit, you got us! We'll help you out, homie. In fact, I need you to do something for me — we're about to take out some motherfuckers who screwed us over on a stash. We can't let them get away with that!\" Mitchell goes over the details of what he wants Howie to do. It doesn't seem right, but Mitchell tells Howie that he's \"in too far to back out\" and that he will be \"as good as dead\" if he does. Mitchell reminds Howie that his crew supported him when he was a nobody—a total loser—so Howie feels he has to carry out the plan to keep his cousin happy. Howie gets caught, arrested and his probation is revoked. He will be serving prison time on theft and aggravated assault.\" </i>",

Everyone wants to feel a part of a group. The more we want to be accepted, the more likely we are to do whatever it takes to belong, even if that means belonging with the wrong crowd. </li><li><b>2. Security</b>- We want to be around others who share similar values and attitudes because they provide a sense of security and safety. We want to feel protected and being part of a group often gives us this feeling. </li><li><b>3. Sense of Purpose</b>- The benefits of criminal or antisocial behavior often include money, excitement, or status (power, authority, control over others). These things can boost our self-confidence and give us a sense of accomplishment. When we are around other people who are also committing crime or not following the rules, it makes antisocial behavior seem ok and even normal because it’s accepted. But, ultimately, the standard of what’s acceptable table-dark gets lower, and our behaviors move farther up on the criminalness meter. In other words, antisocial others encourage these criminal benefits and give your behaviors meaning, so we continue them. </li><li><b>4. Mentoring</b>- We see the benefits of others’ behavior such as money, excitement, or status. We often envy our friends' lifestyle, so we imitate what they are doing. In other words, we see the benefits of what they do and we try the same things to get the same benefits. But, remember that antisocial associates often think of the immediate benefits and not the long-term consequences. Fast money and wild parties may seem like a great time, but they can get people into big trouble down the road. And these kinds of behaviors will catch the attention of your supervising officer – and not their good attention. Pissing off your community supervisor or other officers (police) may get you a tough reputation among other people, including other probationers, but will likely win you extra restrictions...or worse, a community supervision violation."

Having too much free time will open you up for wandering thoughts like 'I wonder how my ex-boyfriend is doing' or 'do my cousins still live in that one neighborhood?' Having too much free time leaves your schedule wide open for trouble. So when you DO check up on that ex-boyfriend or those cousins of yours, and they say, 'we should catch up, it's been too long!' you are more likely to join in because you have nothing else that you should be doing. You make it easier to say, 'well, okay but just this one time.' That one time will definitely be a yellow light situation, and like you learning earlier, can quickly turn into a red-light situation! To use up any free time you have in your schedule, plan out your week. Using the following guides to fill up your schedule as much as you can. <br><b>Things you should definitely have on your schedule </b>: <ul><li> Supervising officer visits </li><li> Planned drug tests </li><li> Group therapy appointments </li><li> Work schedule </li><li> School schedule </li><li> Doctor's appointments </li><li> Medication refill dates </li><li> Family events </li></ul> <br><b>Things you can have on your schedule if you have too much free time:</b> <ul><li> Visit the public library to research jobs, schools, find books to read </li><li> Go to the community center to swim, play games, socialize with other prosocial people </li><li> Set a 2-hour block of time each day of the week to exercise </li><li> Set aside one night a week to visit with supportive family members </li><li> Schedule one morning a week to have coffee with a prosocial friend </li><li> Pick two nights a week to spend on hobbies or things you enjoy on your own </li></ul>",

Ready</b>— this is the step where you prepare yourself for the conversation <ul><li> Start to think positively — se yourself meeting new people and making a good impression. Positive thoughts like \"This is good for me\" or \"I can do this\" are essential. </li><li> Get your \"game face on.\" Smile. Have an open posture with your arms relaxed. Approaching people with your arms crossed or folded is threatening. If you feel awkward with your hands at your side, put your hands in your pocket. </li><li> Remember that shyness can be interpreted by others as arrogance or disinterest. Showing fear can also cause your trouble because antisocial people feed off of fear. So, it's better to be open to conversations with people and feel confident in doing so. </li><li> Don't forget that there are other people in your community, neighborhood, treatment group, or at work who are nervous and talking with them might put them at ease. If you relieve their anxiety and they feel good, this leaves them with a good impression of you. </li></ul><br> <b> 2. Introduce Yourself</b>— this is the step where you make the first move and start the conversation <ul><li> Don't wait for someone to come to you, just go to them. </li><li> Look for someone who is not involved in conversation, they may be having some social anxiety, too. </li><li> Give something before you ask for something. For example, it's more polite and less threatening to say, \"My name is ________. What's yours?\" than to say, \"Who are you?\" Here, you are giving your name before you ask for theirs. </li><li> If you don't catch someone's name the first time, ask them to repeat it. People are usually not offended by this if you ask politely. It shows that are you are interested in remembering who they are. Saying the other person's name in the conversation will also help you remember it. </li><li> Shaking hands is always acceptable table-dark when you meet someone for the first time. </li><li> Smile, keep positive thoughts, and look the person in the eyes (but don't stare at them!). </li></ul> <br> <b> 3. Small Talk</b>— this is the step where you keep the conversation going <ul><li> You assume the burden of conversation. This means that you are ready to talk even if the other person isn't. </li><li> Have several \"go to\" topics in your head that you can use to get a conversation started or to keep one going. The best topics are ones that most people know something about. That's why most people talk about the weather because it is a common experience. Your \"Go To\" topics should be general and something you know about. For example, something current in sports or world news. </li><li> You should never have a strong opinion on a topic, just act like an interested observer. When you're meeting someone for the first time, you don't want to overwhelm them! So, don't talk about things like politics or religion. Neutral topics are always best — like a recent natural disaster. Once you get to know a person better, then you can have more meaningful conversations. </li><li> Never agree with strong negative statements about others. Politely nodding your head means you agree with the statement in the other peoples' eyes. You can politely say \"I have never seen/heard of that before\" or \"That has not been my experience.\" You don't want to get mixed up in someone else's drama or problems </li><li> If the person you are talking to does not know anything about topic number 1 then go to your next topic. </li></ul> <br><b> Wrap Up and Exit</b>— this is the step where you evaluate how the conversation is going and end it appropriately <ul><li> Figure out how the conversation is going. You don't want to waste someone's time, or yours for that matter. If the other person looks bored or disinterested, notice it and politely excuse yourself. If you want to move on, you can also excuse yourself by saying something like, \"Alright, well I'll let you go. It was nice talking with you.\" </li><li> If the conversation is going well, leave with an opening like \"Alright, man, well it was good meeting you, maybe I'll see you here again.\" </li></ul> <br> These 4 steps can be helpful in a number of situations besides meeting new friends. You can use these steps when applying for a job or meeting a new community supervision officer for the first time. People will be impressed with your skills. And, if you ever get stuck in a social situation, just think about how you would like to feel when the conversation is over. Or, if you were the other person, how would you like to be spoken to or treated while in a conversation? ",

Bullying may seem like a childish thing to do, but it is a big problem in the community, at work, and even in jailsand prisons. Unfortunately, bullying doesn’t stop in adulthood, even though you may not call it bullyinganymore. Adults bully and get bullied, too. Bullying may be direct violence (physical abuse, assault), indirect aggression (talking down to you, spreading rumors), or non-consensual sexual violence or coercion (rape, molestation, fondling). Sometimes, bullies just want to control someone. They want to feel like they have power over someone else. Sadly, many people end up doing exactly what the bully wants them to dobecause it’s better than the alternative! There are many reasons why people let bullies take advantage of them—you will learn about some of the reasons later in this Module. <br> People can bully others on their own or as part of a group. Groups of people, like biker gangs or party groups, bully people together. Sometimes, if you're part of a group that is manipulative, it's more difficult to tell you are being bullied because you feel like it's all part of the fun or initiation. You may even join in on bullying others within the group. Regardless of whether it is one person or a group that is the bully, the damage they cause to other people is just as harmful. People who take advantage of you or threaten you can also be called <b><i>manipulative</b></i> or <b><i>abusive</b></i>. These words all reger to the same kinds of hurtful actions and ways of mistreating you. Manipulation and abuse can be more indirect and can involve people convincing you to do things you don't want to do. Some manipulators and abusers are so good, you won't even realize you're falling victim. You yourself may be good at taking advantage of other people. ",

This connection could be based on race, ethnicity, a particular belief system (religion, politics...), family ties, or geographic location (where people grew up or livecurrently). Gangsform both in and out of prisons. Gangs can have several purposes including (1) providing protection and caretaking, (2) unity and fellowship, and (3) profit-making criminal activity (for example, gambling, loan-sharking, selling street drugs, contract murder, and prostitution). Gangs have a hierarchy of command –in other words, people hold varying ranks of power or authority within the gang. These gangs also work through a code of conduct, meaning that there are certain expectations and rules to follow. Not following these rulescould get you into trouble, hurt, or even killed. <br> At worst, gangs are violent social networks. They use violence as a way to bond with each other, defend themselves, establish social status, obtain money or things of value, and control others. At best, gangs are manipulative and controlling.

      "text": "Gangs, especially prison gangs,are common because they serve a purpose. They benefit people in some ways. Here are some of the ways gangs seem attractive and helpful to people: <ul><li> Gangs help people cope with highly stressful living conditions, such as the restrictive conditions in a prison (living without independence, sexual contact, or safety) or the hard conditions of poor neighborhoods (living without parental support, stable table-dark food, or shelter). Gangs are a way for people to feel safe and get access to what they need, including contraband or even a new place to call home. </li><li> Gangs can help people feel comfortable table-dark because their ways of life are familiar. For prison gangs, the rules, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that gangs follow inside the prison walls are similar to the rules, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that people followed outside the prison walls. Outside prison, gang members bond over growing up in the same poor neighborhood or with similar feelings of being uncared for and selecting a new, preferred family. Handling problems with violence is a way of life for some people. You read about this in the first activity: Understanding My Emotions. </li></ul><br><b>Don't Be Fooled...</b><br>Gangs may seem like a good option if you are feeling lonely or scared, but the problems caused by gangs <b><i>far</b></i> outweigh their benefits. Here are some of the ways gangs can harm people: <ul><li> Gang members are at greater risk of violating their community supervision terms, additional criminal convictions, and possibly more time in prison. Getting in trouble so much distracts you from your personal goals. As a gang member, you may not even be allowed to participate in certain programs that would help you reach your goals because of your violent tendencies or rule-breaking behaviors. This means you may not get the help you really need. </li><li> Gang members are also at greater risk of being the victims of violence. In fact, gang membership is just as strongly related to being a victim of crime as it is to being a perpetrator of crime. For example, inmates who are in prison gangs are 4x more likely than inmates who are not in prison gangs to be victimized. This is because gangs are not well liked by other inmates or community members, and especially not by other gangs in or out of prison. If you gang puts out a murder hit on another gang, that gang is going to seek revenge and retaliate. Getting caught in the middle of gang wars can get you seriously hurt or killed. So, even though people turn to gangs for protection, they actually put you in more harm! </li><li> Gang membership is not good for your mental health or criminalness.Although being in a gang may seem secure and safe at first, you soon need to constantly watch your back for danger. This can increase anxiety, fear, depression, paranoia, and other mental health symptoms. In addition, gang activities are usually illegal, thus automatically putting you high on the criminalness meter. The gang mentality encourages criminal thinking and makes criminal conduct seem ok and normal. </li><li> Gangs threaten the overall safety of the community. Gang activity leads to a breakdown of safety and security controls. Gangs create a lot of disorder and violent activity that reduce police and family's ability to keep community and family members safe. This leads to increased assaults on both police officers and innocent bystanders, who were never meant to be hurt. </li></ul><br> Stay away from gangs! Once you get involved in one, you may never be able to get out. The people you meet in a gang are not your friends; they will put your life on the line to save their own. You are disposable and replaceable to them.  ",

Are you saying that we're alcoholics?\" <br> They may even take advantage of the fact that you are staying sober: <br> \"Well, in that case, you can DD (be the designated driver) - the least you could do is save us money on a cab.\" <br> These friends will not understand when you are uncomfortable table-dark in a certain place, or want to leave the bar early: <br> \"What's your fuckin' problem? You used to beg us to come here - and now you don't even want to stay. I should have never invited you.\" <br> And when you decide to take care of yourself by leaving a risky situation instead of driving everyone home, they will say things to make you feel bad for making the right choice: <br> \"I always knew you were a pussy. You can't go anywhere without dragging everyone down with you. Don't even think about coming to my party next weekend—and I want those shoes you borrowed back!\" <br> Cliques and crews can be hard to break away from because they act like they are your friends—they will make you feel good, compliment you, help you get into exclusive parties or concerts, and rally with you when someone treats your poorly. But as soon as you choose to take care of yourself, rather than the crew, they turn on you. They see that as a sign of treason, that taking care of yourself is bad for the group. As a result, they will exclude you, talk badly about you, and make you feel like you are nothing without them. This is unhealthy for you because you need to prioritize taking care of yourself, staying out of risky situations, and surrounding yourself with people who will support you. This is especially true because you are on community supervision. These cliques or crews will do the complete opposite as soon as you don't do what they want you to do. <br> This isn't to say you can't have a group of friends. But you now have to be more aware and careful about who is in this group. You have to be more exclusive about who you let in. When you talk about following rules, doing right, and being in treatment, who are the people who show support> When you tell people that you won't serve as DD every time just because you stopped drinking so much, who are the ones saying, \"That's cool, man, we get it.\" Who are the people who don't give you shit when you try to care for yourself instead of them?",

      "text": "Master Manipulators can be hard to spot sometimes. This is because they often hide their intention by being friendly, or they might start out with less serious forms of bullying that you may not pick up on right away (such as gossiping behind your back, posting messages on social media). Here are some warning signs that you might be dealing with a bully: <ul><li> Bullies often groom their victims, meaning that they manipulate their victims over time. For example, they may be-friend you first by saying they share some of your interests. They try to reel you in and get you to trust them before they take advantage of you. Victims are usually unaware that they are being groomed! </li><li> Bullies create an imbalance of power between themselves and their victims. Again, they may achieve this slowly over time. If you don’t feel like an equal when you are around this person (for example, they make all the decisions, boss you around, use your belongings, call you mean names, make you feel less-than), then you may be a victim of bullying. </li><li> Bullies are often younger (under 35 years old), have a more serious criminal history, such as more violent offenses than their victims, have drug or alcohol problems, are not involved in treatment programs, are not following the rules of community supervision, are more physically aggressive, have a larger and stronger physical appearance than their victims, and express pro-criminal attitudes (that is, beliefs that support criminal activity and reject rule-following behaviors). They may also be members of gangs. </li><li> For women especially, bullies take over a relationship with their own needs which, again, creates an imbalance of power. They may even convince others to turn against you if you don’t put the bully or group first. When you go against the group, you could be put on blast or ousted. This is called \"relational aggression.\" Women tend to be less violent than men—but they use relational aggression and verbal aggression more than men. So their bullying usually looks more like insults, excluding you from activities, or gossiping. </li></ul><br> Remember that it only takes one time — one act of aggression — to be considered bullying!",

      "text": "There are some ways that you can avoid being a victim of bullying. This involves knowing yourself and being aware of the situations you put yourself in. <ul><li> Your mental illness puts you at higher risk for bullying. Bullies target people who they see as weak. Even though mental illness is not a weakness – it is a chemical imbalance triggered by stressful events – many people who bully will see your symptoms as a sign that you are easily controllable. This is because they don’t know as much about mental illness as they think. Therefore, it is essential that you manage your mental health symptoms; use the techniques that you have learned to reduce your depression, anxiety, fear, and psychotic symptoms so you do not attract bullies. You don’t want to look out of control. </li><li> Walk and stand with confidence. If you look weak and timid, someone will try to take advantage of that. Portray an image of strength and courage (try the technique of acting opposite if you have trouble feeling confident). But, be careful not to appear too arrogant or as if you are more important than others. This will make people angry and make you a target for violence. Don’t become the bully yourself! </li><li> Be aware of people who try to corner you or lead you to a secluded area away from treatment providers or community supervision offices, from family or friends, in alleyways, or abandoned parts of town. If you find yourself in an isolated area with another person, leave the area right away and talk about it with your counselor or community supervision officer. </li><li> <b>NOTHING IN LIFE IS FREE!</b> If someone offers you something for free, they usually expect to be re-paid somehow. Do not indebt yourself to <b><i>anyone</b></i> for <b><i>anything</b></i>, including food, drugs, bus passes, or other resources! You don't need to be paranoid of everyone you know or meet. But, think hard about who is offering it and why they are offering it. Can this person be trusted? Be especially concerned if the thing they want to give you is of high value. Someone giving you a candy bar could be trying to be nice and make a friend. But someone giving you a car will probably want another vehicle or the money paid back eventually. </li><li> You are more likely to be a victim of bullying if you are younger, smaller in physical size, White, gay, new to community supervision, are smart or intellectual, lack street-smarts, are \"passive\" (see <u>Understanding My Emotions</u>), or have been convicted of a sexual offense. You may not be able to do much to change these characteristics, but they can help you become more aware of your risk for bullying. Men are more likely to be a victim of bullying if they have \"feminine\" characteristics such as long hair or a high voice. Women are more likely to be a victim of bullying if they are nice to other people, are \"passive,\" and look like they can be overpowered, taken advantage of, or manipulated. </li><li> Do not provoke known bullies. Don't try to \"win out\" over them or give them \"a taste of their own medicine.\" They will eventually get in trouble for their behaviors or push people away. Provoking bullies will only make the situation worse and possibly get you into trouble as well. When bullies are really getting to you, use some of the strategies you have learned like positive self-talk, cognitive restructuring, thought stopping, or relaxation techniques (PMR, deep breathing, guided imagery) to block them out. </li></ul><br> It's important to avoid being the victim of bullying because you can experience a number of negative effects including increased risk for suicide and self-injury, worsening mental health problems, and continued victimization.

William is thin and frail looking (mostly from using too much dope), he’s White, and has long stringy hair. He keeps to himself a lot and never makes much eye contact with other people. Some of the other people in the community supervision treatment group call him “weird,” “a fag,” and “a loser.” One day after the treatment group meeting ended, another supervisee named Sully starts talking to William. Sully’s on parole after serving prison time for aggravated robbery. This is his second time on parole, so he knows the ropes. Sully boasts about how well he knows the small town, and about the people he knows – people who will do things for him. Sully tells William that he used to be just like him, scared, hopeless, and at the bottom of the barrel. Sully offers to help William with his problems. Soon, the name-calling stops, and William is relieved; he feels safe. Sully seems like a cool guy, he even brought William a pack of cigarettes to the next group meeting. But, a few weeks later, Sully and William were walking back from the laundry mat late at night. Sully steers William into a dark alley and tries to touch William inappropriately. When William backs away, Sully says, “No one takes from me without giving back.\"</i>"

This time, he’s finishing his sentence for burglarizing a home and stealing high-priced valuables. Shawn has the urge to steal most often when he is manic. Doing something exciting like that is what helps him cope with his high moods. While on probation, he manages his mania by riding the city bus and shouting at other passengers, pacing about the bus while in motion, and hitting the bus windows. The police are often called, and Shawn has to explain his actions to his supervising officer or other police officers who don't know him well. Shawn has had several restrictions and required treatment groups because of his actions. Ivy also has Bipolar Disorder and notices that Shawn has been getting into trouble a lot for his behaviors. Before a treatment group meeting, Ivy approaches Shawn and tells him that she shares some of the same symptoms and that she’s been spending time at the public library and parks, taking medications, and doing her best to follow his supervision terms. Ivy tells Shawn that she’s “sick of this shit” and wants to finish probation so she can make a real life for herself. Shawn asks Ivy how she started seeing a doctor for medications so he can make an appointment for himself. After a few weeks, Shawn and Ivy begin attending group together and exercising at the park. Sometimes, Shawn and Ivy work on their treatment group assignments together.\"</i>"

He knows a lot of people, both on and off parole, who are willing to take risks for him. Marcel has a reputation on the streets as a ‘baron’ – meaning that he can get people whatever they want for a price. Drugs, weapons, intel, women, just about anything. Marcel is on parole after spending time in prison for yet another supervision violation, but these violations haven’t stopped him. Working with Marcel is great: he’s friendly, delivers on time, and he doesn’t ask for the money up front. But Marcel makes a lot of money doing this because he charges customers a high interest rate. If you can’t pay up, Marcel knows people to take care of you. Eric is a petty thief and an addict. He has a long criminal history starting as a juvenile. He’s been on parole and house arrest this time for aggravated assault – a theft gone wrong. Eric is not the most street savvy guy (he keeps getting caught!). After not leaving the house for weeks, he’s starting to feel withdrawal from meth and seeks Marcel’s help. Marcel gets Eric what he needs but charges him twice what it would cost him to go out and find it himself. Eric is desperate, so he doesn’t care. After a while, Eric becomes a primary customer and begins racking up debt with Marcel. Marcel doesn’t seem to make a big fuss about the money…yet.\"</i>"
