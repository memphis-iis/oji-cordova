Your symptoms may be very serious and cause a lot of problems or they may be minor and relatively easy to control. No matter what kind of symptoms you have, this module will help you better understand mental illness generally and how it may impact you specifically. You’ll also learn several new coping skills to try out and how best to track the effects of any medications you may be taking.",

      "text": "Mental illness happens when your mind is not working right. There are two factors that cause your mind to do things that are not normal for you: <b>(1) Biology</b> and <b>(2) Environment</b>. Biology means the stuff already inside of you, like your genetics or chemicals in your brain. Mental illness is sometimes inherited from people in your family. You may know other family members who have a mental illness quite similar to the one you have. There are also chemicals in your brain that send messages to other parts of your brain –these messages tell your mind how to think and act. These chemicals are called neurotransmitters(neuro = brain; transmitter = sending messages). When your neurotransmitters are not working correctly, the wrong messages get sent to the different parts of your brain. This is called a chemical imbalance. There are many different types of neurotransmitters in your brain; the symptoms you experience depend on which ones stop functioning properly. But, biology isn’t enough. You also need to experience stress in your environment (for example, death of a loved one, loss of a job, childhood abuse, or incarceration). When your biology AND your environment areworking against you, it increases your chances of having a mental illness (it’s no guarantee, just very likely).",

      "text": "<ul><li>Mental illness is usually experienced as a thought or behavior that causes stress or emotional (andeven physical) pain to you or the people around you. These thoughts and behaviors may look different for different people, even if they have the same mental illness that you have. </li><li> Mental illness is not simply a reaction to stress. What makes something a mental illness is when the thought or behavior is not typical (or abnormal) for other people in your culture. Take anxiety for example. Anxiety is normal sometimes. You may have felt anxious or nervous about coming to this restricted housing unit. That’s understandable; it’s an uncomfortable table-dark and sometimes scary place to be. But, when your anxiety is so high that you can’t eat, can’t sleep, can’t communicate with other people, or can’t bring yourself to shower or exercise, your anxiety could be a symptom of mental illness. Those behaviors are not normal and could cause a lot of problems for you. </li><li> A doctor or counselor who went to school to learn about mental illness determines the type of mental illness that you have. What these professionals look for is a specific group of symptoms that happen at the same time. These clusters of symptoms make up a diagnosis (diagnosis simply means the label or name used to describe each cluster of symptoms). Diagnosis helps professionals communicate about a person’s mental illness quickly and easily. It can also give people some relief that there is a name for what they are going through. </li><li> To have a mental illness, you don’t have to experience ALL symptoms which make up that particular diagnosis, and not everyone will express these symptoms in the same way. To make a correct diagnosis, your doctor or counselor needs very specific information about you. This is why it is important to be honest with them when they ask you about your mental health. If you lie to them, they cannot help you get better. They have more knowledge about this stuff than you might think. If you have not told the truth to your doctor or counselor in the past, go back and tell them what’s really going on. They understand that it can be difficult to talk about mental illness. </li><li> Many people have a mental illness. Mental health problems are especially common in prisons and in disciplinary units. Nearly 16% of people who are incarcerated are believed to have a mental illness. </li><li> You often cannot tell just by looking at a person if they have a mental illness or not. Lots of people with mental illnesses look like they hold it together on the outside, but, on the inside, they are hurting. Your cellmate or neighbor may have a mental illness, and you just don’t know it. </li><li> It is <b><u>NOT</b></u> your fault that you have a mental illness. But, this isn’t an excuse for your behavior. You are responsible for managing your symptoms so they don’t end up getting the best of you and take you away from your goals. </ul></li>",

      "text": "The fact is – you may never get over your mental illness for good. Many people must work for therest of their lives to manage symptoms of their mental illness. It doesn’t go away forever. But, this doesn’t mean you have to suffer forever. Imagine being sick with a cold (fever, chills, headache). What do you need to do to get better again? Take medicine, get lots of rest, drink plenty of water, and eat soup. Once the symptoms are gone, the cold is over. There is no need to continue taking medicine, resting, guzzling water, or eating soup. This is not true with mental illness. Yes, there are things youcan do to feel better, but you can never give up working on it. The good news is –the more you practice new skills, the easier your work will become. It may not even feel like work after a while. <br> You are going to start breaking the old habits that keptyour symptoms going and develop new habits that keep your symptoms under control. And if you’re wondering whether treatment programs like this one can work, the answer is YES. Many times, people also need medication to help with their symptoms (medications can correct your neurotransmitters). So, it’s important that you take these if the doctor tells you to; remember he or she is trained about this stuff. You always have the right to ask questions about your medications if you are confused. For many mentalillnesses, there is a 70-80% chance that people will see improvements in their lives if they take the necessary steps. But you must be an active participant. If you sit there and wait for change to happen, you will be sitting and waiting for a long time. <u><i><b>YOU</u></i></b> HAVE TO DO SOMETHING! ",

Mania, on the other hand, causes people to be in very high moods (without using substances). Bipolar (bi = two, polar = sides) is characterized by BOTH high and low moods.

Stigmais a negative opinion or feeling that someone has about another person (or group of people) who they don’t know a lot about. It happens when people don’t understand something. So, they base their opinion on what little information they do have. Stigmatizing beliefs can come from many sources –seeing a movie, watching the news, hearing a story, social stereotypes, or having short interactions with only a few people who belong to a particular group. All of these sources can lead to negative and, often, incorrect judgments about people. You can be stigmatized by people in the general public (“Everyone with mental problems is just crazy and weird”) or by your own attitudes (“Having to goto therapy is embarrassing; it must mean that I’m a weak person”). Stigma can make it difficult for you to cope with your mental illness, integrate back into society, hold a job, or secure housing. Luckily, when people learn more about mental illness and meet people who have mental illnesses, their stigmas begin to go away. This is true for other stigmas as well (e.g. “Criminals are always bad people,” “Lawyers are nothing but liars and cheats,” “Gays are dirty”). ",

Here are some ways to do this: <br> Educate yourself about mental disorders <ul><li>Learn as much about your own mental disorders as you can. This helps reduce your own self-stigma (thoughts that make you feel bad about your mental illness) and helps you learn more about who you are. Knowing about your mental illness will also help you to educate other people about your symptoms and your need for help or special accommodations. You already started to do this with these worksheets. </li><li> Becoming part of a group can also help you learn more about different mental illnesses. So, take advantage of opportunities to talk with other inmates who have similar problems, and ask to join mental health groups if they are offered on your unit and once you return to the general population. </li></ul> <br> Confront other people who have incorrect thoughts about mental illness <ul><li> For example, if another inmate says that mentally ill people are violent, you can tell him that only a very small number are actually dangerous and that most mentally ill people are not a threat at all. His opinion may have come from news reports or because he is in a prison and has no other experience to base his opinion. </li><li> Don’t buy into jokes about mental illness (i.e. mocking or making fun of someone for their mental problems). This only encourages stigma. Use your knowledge to educate the jokesters. Don’t worry if this puts you in bad favor with those people. They’re probably not going to be helpful to you in reaching your goals anyway. If it would be physically dangerous to confront someone, just walk away. The important thing is that you do not participate in behaviors that support stigma. </li><li> You don’t ever have to tell people about your mental illness. You can simply be a teacher and help people learn. </li></ul> <br>Tell people about your mental illness when it can help you <ul><li> Sometimes it is better to tell people about your mental illness. But, give it some thought first. Ask yourself: how will this benefit me? For example, let’s say Todd has a job as a salesman that requires him to go door-to-door. The problem is that Todd has social anxiety. He gets nervous talking to other people and that hurts his sales performance. Todd tells his boss about this problem and asks for 1 hour off each week so he can attend counseling and learn to cope with his anxiety. In this case, Todd told his boss because he needed special accommodations to be better at this job. </li></ul> <br> Stigma is a barrier to your health and well-being, but you CAN do things to soften the impact for yourself and other people with mental illness.

To recap, recovery looks different depending on what it is you’re recovering from. And, not everyone’s road to recovery will be the same. To use the example we saw before, to recover from a medical illness like a cold or the flu, you might take medications, eat soup, and rest easy. You stop this routine once you feel better. Like with your criminalness, recovery from mental illness is different than a cold or the flu. You are not working to cure it or make it go away forever. It is about <b>controlling parts of your life that cause distress and emotional difficulty.</b> Remember you must ALWAYS work toward recovery; if you stop, you will likely go back to where you started in the first place. This is true even if you are starting to feel better. Feeling better does not mean you stop working on your recovery; it just means that you are doing all the right things and that you must <u>continue</u> to do those things. <br> Your goals will help you figure out what recovery means for you. For example, if Tom’s goal is to reduce anxiety so he can do a better job at work, then recovery for him is when he is able to feel more comfortable table-dark and less stressed at work. With mental illnesses, it is also important to remember two things. First, that you may feel a little worse before you feel better. This is because it is often difficult to look inward at yourself and finally begin to challenge the barriers you’ve faced. We sometimes have to break down barriers that we, ourselves, were responsible for building! Second, for most people, they don’t ever get over their mental illness, they simply learn to have more positive days than negative ones. So, again, you shouldn’t expect that your symptoms to stop. But they should become less intense and more manageable. ",

But, as you learn new ways to cope with your symptoms of mental illness, you will: <ul><li> Be in a better mood and feel happier </li><li> Have stronger and more meaningful relationships with other people </li><li> Get into trouble less often </ul></li> <br> Don’t stop when things get tough. And, even when you feel solid in your recovery (like you can tackle any problem head-on), there are always obstacles to watch out for. For many people who have a criminal history and a mental diagnosis, these two things interact. That is, managing you symptoms of mental illness may be necessary to manage your criminalness. For example, some people take medications to help reduce aggression and agitation. Not taking those medications could place them at risk for acting out in aggressive ways that could get them in trouble. While mental illness is never your fault, it is your responsibility to learn how to cope with it and be aware of your warning signs and triggers of relapse (remember the yellow and red zones from your mental traffic light; <u>Re-Creating the Self: Making Change Happen</u>).

You’ll notice that these tips are pretty similar to what you read about in <u>Understanding and Coping with Criminalness</u>. <ul><li> Believing that goals –whether big or small– are very important. Make it a priority to achieve your goals. Don’t be embarrassed, ashamed, or afraid of your goals. They’re yours, so own them. </li><li> Writing down goals to keep you on track. Having goals written down somewhere serves as a constant reminder. You can look at them when you need a boost. You can also write down some motivational statements to keep you going. </li><li> Keeping in mind what is really important to you, like staying out of segregation. Reminding yourself about the good things that you could get by changing pushes you to move forward. </li><li> Becoming involved in a treatment or self-help group. This may or may not already be mandated for you, but it’s not, see what’s out there and get involved. Talking to other people with similar problems makes you feel more comfortable table-dark talking about your own mental health problems. The more you talk about it, the more you learn about yourself. Groups also help you practice new skills and give you the chance to help others in need. </li><li> Staying active, like working out. Physical activity makes your body produce natural chemicals that make you feel good. Exercise is commonly recommended to people with mental illnesses to improve mood. </li><li> Finding social supports – people who are following the rules and doing pro-social things. Support systems can include family, doctors, counselors, model inmates, your lawyer, a religious person, or anyone else you trust. Share your symptoms and goals with these people so they can keep an eye on you. Sometimes other people are able to notice things you can’t see. Give them permission to tell you when you’re getting distracted from your goals. </li><li> Being aware of your warning signs (yellow) and triggers (red) – things that threaten your recovery. Knowing what these risk factors are helps you to avoid them in the future or prepare to handle them better when you can’t avoid them. What makes you anxious? Depressed? Out of control? </li><li> Using creativity to express yourself. Sometimes you may feel that no one understands you or that you can’t put how you really feel into words. Instead of letting it bottle up and explode later, get creative! Act it out, write a poem, or draw scribbles and doodles. This will help you get your emotions out there and will give you some guidance for talking about it later. </li><li> Following through with your treatment plan! Make a plan and follow it. Decide for yourself what you need to do on your road to recovery, such as what risks do you need to take, what challenges should you be aware of, how will you deal with those challenges when they come up, and who can you count on to help you? Stick to it! This is something you can have control over. And, don’t forget to reward yourself for a job well done. </ul></li>",

If you relapse and your symptoms begin to get worse, it’s important to see it as a learning experience and not as an excuse to giveup on your goals. What can you learn from the relapse, so you can avoid another one in the future? Maybe you missed one of your warning signs or triggers. ",

Once you see that you are at risk, you can act right away. So, what you need to do is trace the steps that will likely lead to your relapse if you stop working on your recovery. That is, what people, places, environments, behaviors, feelings, or thoughts will likely come BEFORE your let your symptoms get worse? These are the things you need to avoid or learn to deal with if you encounter them. Think back to your history–what path originally led to the feelings and behaviors you’ve been trying to change now? The earlier you can catch your risks, the more likely you will be to prevent it from becoming a full relapse. By now, you should know that it’s easiest to escape a shark attack if you are in the shallowest part of the ocean! <br> Always remember that triggers come directly before a relapse and warning signs come before the trigger. It is easier to stop relapse at the warning signs but not impossible at the triggers. It’s also important to know that everyone has different warning signs and triggers. For example, a trailer for a movie about the government taking over people's lives might be a trigger for one man, who then thinks that the government is watching him through televisions and becomes paranoid and violent. For another man, this trailer may be a warning sign that gets him to think about how scary that would be and how he would respond if he were faced with the same situation. For yet another man, this commercial may be neither a warning sign nor a trigger. ",

You get yourself caught up in a destructive cycle of disordered thinking. Like with criminalness, you have to retrain your brain. Improve your mind’s ability to think clearly and accurately. Changing your thoughts will put you in a better mood. Remember to use your mental traffic light to evaluate how helpful or not helpful your thoughts are.

She finally has an interview lined up and needs to find some nice clothes to wear. She asks her sister, Susan, to take her shopping the weekend before the interview. At first, Susan agreed, but later called to tell Rita she couldn’t take her anymore. Rita begins to feel upset. Her heart sinks, her palms get sweaty, and her mind begins to race. She recognizes that this reaction is a yellow warning sign for her and she decides to evaluate her thoughts. Rita realizes that she thought Susan was purposefully trying to mess up her chances of finding a job and was beginning to think about all the horrible things that would go wrong if she didn’t have new clothes for the interview. These thoughts explain Rita’s anxious feelings! So, to prevent her anxiety from becoming a problem (for example, causing her to hit the bar for a drink and ruin 2 months of sobriety, skipping the job interview), Rita thinks of more helpful thoughts. Perhaps Susan had an emergency with one of her kids. Or, maybe she was having car trouble. And, maybe she can borrow something nice from her neighbor—they’re nearly the same size! These new thoughts don’t necessarily take away Rita’s anxiety entirely or let Susan off the hook for bailing, but they help reduce the intensity of her feelings and prevent her from making a poor choice.\"</i>",

In the last activity you built some awareness around your problem thoughts stemming from symptoms of mental illness. Now, we will talk about challenging them. Remember that your job is to decide how truthful your thinking is. Sometimes additional information is needed to figure out the extent to which your thoughts are true. <br> To remind you, here are some questions you can ask yourself when evaluating the accuracy of your thoughts. Use ALL of them to be the most effective: <ul><li> Is this thought useful or helpful to me? Does it help me reach my goals? Does it help me take positive action? Use your mental traffic light! </li><li> Is this thought familiar? Has my mind told me this before? If so, how did things turn out before? </li><li> What would I get for buying into this thought? That is, if my thought is true, what is the worst thing that could happen? What is the best thing that could happen? What is likely to happen? </li><li> What is the evidence for this thought?  What information do I have in favor of my idea? What information do I have that is against my idea? (Remember, there may be evidence in both directions, just like a trial you might see in a courtroom. But, you are looking for the side of the argument that is the most accurate) </li><li> What will happen if I let this automatic thought impact my feelings and behavior?  What will happen to my feelings and behavior if I change this thought? </li><li> Is there a different explanation for what’s going on?  Are there other ways of looking at the situation? </li><li> What should I do about this?  What do I want to do about this? </li><li> What would I tell a friend if he or she were in the same situation? </li></ul> <br> When you have an automatic thought that stirs up negative feelings that are linked to your mental illness, check your answers to these questions. Then, rate how truthful your original thought was. <br> As a general rule, any rating below about a 10 suggests the possibility that you need to change or alter the thought (at least to some degree). You want to be thinking as clearly as possible, so if there is any room on the meter to move up, think about how you can do so! ",

      "text": "Remember that the word “cognitive” means what or how you think. But, the thought problems described in this worksheet are not about inaccurate ways of thinking about yourself or your situation. These thought problems have to do with your inability to focus, concentrate, or attend to what’s going on around you. Cognitive problems can be a symptom of many different mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, bipolar, and schizophrenia. If you are easily distracted, lose focus on tasks, or have trouble paying attention to what other people are saying to you, then you likely have cognitive problems. <br> The words “concentration” and “attention” mean having the ability to focus on one specific thing (for example, your homework, reading these worksheets, listening to someone talk) for an extended period of time. If you have a hard time doing that, these strategies might be helpful for you. Commit to trying each one by saying out loud, “I will do this!” <br> Strategies to try: <ul><li> Minimize distractions to the best of your ability such that there is only one thing to concentrate on. For example, if you are trying to concentrate on your homework, make sure the radio and TV are off. If it’s noisy where you are and you cannot move, try a meditation technique (PMR, deep breathing, guided imagery, positive self-talk) to help you block out distractions and refocus. </li><li> Nicely ask the person who is talking to you to slow down or repeat things if you missed what he/she said or did not follow along the first time. So, you could ask, “I’m sorry, but could you repeat that for me? I just want to make sure I understand.” Most people do not mind doing this for you. </li><li> Check to make sure you understand what someone is saying to you by summarizing what you heard. For example, you can say something like, “Let me see if I’m following you; are you saying ________?” </li><li> Break down activities or tasks into smaller parts, and take frequent breaks. For example, if you have trouble with these worksheets, read a few sentences, then stop, do a few deep breaths, and then read a few more sentences. You can do this with other things you need to do, too. </li><li> A similar strategy is to start out an activity by spending a brief time on the activity and gradually increasing the amount of time you spend. For example, if you are having difficulty paying attention when reading, you could start by reading a few sentences of an article in a newspaper or a magazine. When you feel comfortable table-dark with that, you could try reading a few paragraphs. After that, you could select a short article and read it entirely. Then you could gradually build up to reading chapters in a book. The important thing is to progress at a pace that is comfortable table-dark for you. </li><li> When you can, ask someone to join you in an activity that requires attention, such as a board game, card game, a jigsaw puzzle, or doing work for a support group. Many people find that doing something with others helps them to focus better. </li></ul>",

His mental illness sometimes causes him to think negatively about himself or the situations that he experiences. His depression also puts him in a sad mood most of the time. Sometimes Calvin’s sad mood and negative thoughts distract him and prevent him from focusing on what’s going on. Yesterday, the correctional officers decided to do a surprise cell search because it was rumored that an inmate on the pod had drug contraband. The officers came to Calvin’s cell and told him that his cell was being searched. They then asked him to cuff up, wait for his cell door to open, and step out toward the right of his cell where he would be detained and strip searched by another officer. Calvin was again distracted by his thoughts and did not understand what the officer said. Calvin didn’t do anything about these thoughts. So, he went through the whole procedure feeling nervous, scared, and confused.  Then, another incident happened today. Calvin was sitting in his cell trying to complete his homework, but he kept losing focus. He would look away every time someone or something on the pod made a loud noise. He also worried that his counselor was going to get on his case about his homework because he felt he was too stupid to do a good job. Calvin got frustrated and stopped doing his homework altogether.”</i> ",

But, as you know, more activity is good for you because it helps you deal with your situation better and reach your goals. Remember that you have to DO something to change. So, it’s important that you improve this area. Here are some ways you can begin to do that. <ul><li> Be patient with yourself. Remember that change is hard, but it will happen slowly. </li><li> Start with an activity that you used to enjoy. Check your activity log for some ideas. Think of something brief that you could do that is related to that activity. For example, if you used to enjoy exercising, you could try doing a few push-ups (5-10 reps) in your cell. Be attentive to what you experience as you work out…How do your muscles feel? Do you feel more relaxed after doing this? As you get more comfortable table-dark with brief activities, gradually plan longer activities. For example, after doing a few push-ups you could try doing a few more reps. </li><li> Check out new interests such as: computers, arts and crafts, reading about different topics like the news, science, or pop culture (remember to pick topics that are pro-social, not violent), telling jokes, listening to music, writing, yoga, observing nature, singing, word games, trivia, puzzles, or many other things. When you get back into the general population, explore what else there is to do and learn about.

Don’t give up the first time you try something new. The more familiar and comfortable table-dark you feel with an activity, the more likely you will enjoy it.

Luke used to live in a dangerous neighborhood. While there, he saw two of his cousins get shot to death on the streets. Also, he suffered several gunshot wounds himself. As a result of this trauma, Luke is always afraid of being hurt again. He worries a lot about his safety and feels helpless about his ability to protect himself. Sometimes the terror gets so bad that he thinks about killing himself to make it go away. Luke is housed on a general population pod within the prison, but he does not like to talk to many people. He usually keeps to himself and stays in his cell even when he is allowed to be in the common area. He doesn’t eat or sleep very well either; he barely picks at his meals and both the noises on the unit and the worried thoughts in his head keep him awake all night. Luke is also scared to use the shower area and the rec yard. Sometimes he will refuse to shower because believes bad things will happen to him there. Luke has a counselor who tries to work with him on his problems, but Luke often confuses the counselor. The counselor doesn’t know if Luke is interested in getting help or if he is even paying attention to their conversations at all. Luke never shows any emotion during their meetings (even though he actually likes being in therapy) and often seems bored. The counselor is thinking about stopping treatment with Luke until he seems ready to move forward.\"",

      "text": "You remember from earlier in the module that psychotic symptoms often happen with mental illnesses like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Two psychotic symptoms are hallucinations and delusions. Hallucinations are sensations (hear, touch, smell, taste, see) that are not real; you may experience them even though nothing is really there. This can make life confusing because you cannot tell what is real and what it not real.  Delusions, on the other hand, are strong ideas that are not real or even impossible, such as believing that aliens are putting thoughts into your head. So, if other people often tell you that they cannot see, hear, smell, taste, or touch the same things can, or if other people tell you that your beliefs are “crazy” or strange, then this worksheet could be helpful to you. <br>  Commit to trying each strategy by saying out loud, \"I will do this!\"",

      "text": "Again, hallucinations are “false perceptions;” your mind is playing tricks on you. Hallucinations sometimes come in episodes, meaning that they go away for some time and then come back again. If your hallucinations come in episodes like this, then the return of hallucinations is a warning sign for relapse. For other people, their hallucinations do not go away between episodes. If you experience hallucinations on a regular basis, you can still learn to manage your symptoms. But, if the hallucinations get worse (for example, voices tell you to do harmful things), then you should talk to a doctor or your counselor. Here are some things you can try to control your hallucinations. <ul><li> Distract yourself by doing something that uses your attention such as having a conversation with someone, reading, or exercising. Some people who hear voices hum to themselves or listen to music to drown out the voices. </li><li> Check out your experiences with someone you trust. For example, one man who thought he heard voices outside his window asked his brother to listen and give an opinion. </li><li> Use positive self-talk. Some people tell themselves things like, “I’m not going to listen to these voices,” “I’m not going to let these voices get to me,” or “I’m just going to stay cool, and the situation will pass.” </li><li> Don’t take your hallucinations seriously or as absolute truths. Instead, try to see your hallucinations as your mind’s way of telling you that you need to start paying closer attention to your thoughts, feelings, and needs. This gives you a better understanding about why the hallucinations are happening to you. For example, one woman heard voices telling her not to go outside. Instead of listening to the voices, she took the command as a sign that she was afraid of something. She then started to think about where her fear was coming from and challenged it. So, look for a symbolic meaning not an exact meaning. </li><li> If you can’t figure out helpful meanings for your hallucinations, just ignore them as much as possible. Some people say that it helps to focus on other things instead. </li><li> Put the hallucinations “in the background.” Some people acknowledge what they are hearing or seeing, but don’t pay any further attention to it. For example, they might tell themselves, “There’s that critical voice again. I’m just going to let it happen and go about my business. I’m not going to let it bother me or affect what I’m doing.” </li><li> Use relaxation techniques. Oftentimes hearing or seeing hallucinations will get worse when people are under stress. Doing some deep breathing or PMR reduces the stress and lessens the intensity of the hallucination. </li><li> If the voices start to tell you to do something to hurt yourself or someone else, and you think you might act on this, talk to a doctor or counselor immediately! If you can’t reach your counselor, tell a staff member on duty. If you do need to involve staff, it might be helpful to share your mental illness with them so they understand that the hallucination is a symptom. If you don’t do this and only tell them that you might hurt yourself (or whatever you are thinking about doing), then they will handle the situation much differently. Consequently, you could find yourself with a disciplinary sanction. </li></ul>",

      "text": "Sometimes, people have beliefs that are firmly held even when there is no clear evidence to supportthem. For example, they might start to believe that the FBI is monitoring their phone calls even though there is no evidence of this. Or, they might believe that people are talking about them or staring at them. Delusions sometimes come in episodes, meaning that they go away for some time and then come back again. If your delusions come in episodes like this, then their return is a warning sign for relapse. For other people, these beliefs do not go away. If you experience delusions on a regular basis, you can still learn to manage your symptoms. But, if the delusions get worse or more bizarre, then you should talk to a doctor or your counselor. Here are some things you can try to control your delusions. <ul><li> Distract yourself from the disturbing belief by doing something that takes your mental attention, such as doing a puzzle or adding up rows of numbers. You can also try one of your relaxation techniques like deep breathing, PMR, or guided imagery. </li><li> Check out your beliefs by talking to someone you trust. For example, you might ask your counselor to help you look at the evidence for and against your belief. Ask for his or her point of view. If your beliefs cause you to worry about safety, for example, you might ask, /“What is the evidence that supports that I am in danger, and what is the evidence that does not support I am in danger?” This is very similar to cognitive restructuring and changing automatic thoughts. </li><li> Distract yourself with a physical activity, such as doing a few push-ups. </li><li> Keep in mind that you should contact your doctor or counselor if you become so convinced of your belief that you are thinking of acting on it. For example, if you become convinced that someone means you harm, you might start thinking of defending yourself, which could possibly lead you to harm someone else. If you can’t reach your counselor, tell a staff member on duty. If you do need to involve staff, it might be helpful to share your mental illness with them so they understand that the delusion is a symptom. If you don’t do this and only tell them that you might hurt someone (or whatever you are thinking about doing), then they will handle the situation much differently and you could find yourself with a disciplinary sanction. </li></ul>",

They would call him a failure and laugh at him. Andy started using heroin to deal with the voices and to shut them up. Andy also sold large amounts of heroin for which resulted in his incarceration. In prison, Andy still hears the voices sometimes. When Andy is stressed out, his symptoms get worse and the voices will warn him of dangers that aren’t really there. They say things like, “Don’t go out there, you’re going to die” or “Make a shank and hurt yourself.” Andy is at a point where he thinks others are plotting to kill him. Whenever he is in the common area with other inmates, he always thinks they are looking at him and talking bad about him. This agitates Andy. He sometimes has angry outbursts where he will yell and scream at the people he believes are planning to cause him harm. Other inmates and staff don’t know what to do about Andy because he is sometimes very unpredictable table-dark.” ",

      "text": "Remember that interpersonal problems means that you have difficulty talking to or interacting with other people; these are problems related to your social relationships. Such relationships may be between you and family or friends, your counselor, facility staff, your lawyer, other inmates, doctors, or anyone else. Interpersonal problems are very common in people who have personality disorders, such as Borderline, Antisocial, Narcissistic, and Schizotypal. If you tend to have rocky or unstable table-dark relationships, don’t get along well with others, or find that you don’t fit in well with others, this worksheetmay be helpful for you. <br> Commit to trying each strategy by saying out loud, “I will do this!” <br> Strategies to Try: <br> Deal with interpersonal problems ahead of time. Think about upcoming social situations that are likely to make you feel anxious or awkward. Imagine the situation clearly in your mind and rehearse how you will handle the situation. Ask yourself these questions: <ul><li> What will you say? </li><li> What is the other person likely to try? </li><li> What is likely to happen? </li><li> What would you want to happen? </li><li> How would you like the other person to feel about you when the interaction is over? </li><li> How would you like to feel about yourself when the interaction is over? </li><li> What can you do to make the interaction better? </li></ul> This way you will be prepared when a similar situation comes up. <br> Remember, your assertiveness and conflict resolution skills. Don’t be aggressive or passive; this won’t get you what you really want or need. You can still be respectful even if you disagree with someone. <br> Think about your own goals, values, and beliefs. Keeping these in mind will help you act in ways that make you feel proud – including dealing with other people. <br> Be aware of your common criminal thinking styles, as many of these styles involve blaming other people (inmates, staff, doctors) for things or putting other people down (“That job was easy…Any idiot could have done that.”). People don’t like this very much, so it doesn’t help you make good relationships. <br> Practice good communication skills. Give someone some information about you before you ask something of him or her. For example, you can say something like, “Hi, my name is _____. What’s your name?” Here, you gave the person your name before asking for theirs. That sounds much better than saying, “Who are you?” But, don’t always talk about yourself! <br> Be aware of your body language. Don’t stand in a threatening manner; don’t clench your fists, cross your arms, or stand over people. Especially in prison, this type of body language can lead to trouble. <br> Prepare topics of conversation and use them when you need to start a conversation or keep a conversation going. But, don’t use topics that get people all worked up like politics, religion, abortion, gay rights, etc. This doesn’t leave a very good impression because it pushes people’s buttons. When you get to know a person better, then you can talk about deeper issues. <br> Sometimes, people are worried about how good they will be in social situations. For example, they might think, “They won’t like me;” “I won’t do it right;” or “I’ll probably fall apart.” People can also worry about asking others for something (i.e. to be treated differently in a relationship, to ask for more information about their medications). These people may think things like, “If they say ‘no’, it will kill me;” “I have to know that a person will say ‘yes’ before I ask them to do something;” “If I make a request, I will seem like a weak person;” or “I don’t like when people are upset with me.” And yet, some people are worried about how to say ‘no’ when others ask for something (for example, if someone asks you to do something you don’t want to do). They might think, “Saying ‘no’ is selfish;” “I can’t say ‘no’ because this person is more powerful than I am;” or “They won’t like me anymore if I don’t do this.” <br> You guessed it… Challenging automatic thoughts and using positive self-talk can help you here, too. <br> Use “I” statements to express your feelings and opinions. Don’t assume people know how you feel. Instead, tell the person exactly what you’re reacting to. Hinting at the problem or beating around the bush only confuses people. <br> When making a request, use phrases such as, “I would like” or “I don’t want” instead of saying, “you should” or “I need.” For example, saying something like, “I need you to tell me about the side effects of these medications” will sound pushy and demanding. Rather, you might say, “I would like more information about the side effects of the medication I’m taking.” This way, you still get what you wanted, but keeps a healthy relationship. And, be confident when asking! Even if someone says ‘no,’ it doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t have asked. <br> If you want to say ‘no’ to someone, be firm and confident (use eye contact, don’t stammer or whisper, or say “I’m not sure”). Having a clear reason for saying ‘no’ may help you express your opinion or emotions. <br> If you can’t come to an agreement with someone (either because you don’t want to fulfill their request, or because they don’t want to fulfill yours), you can try to negotiate or make a compromise. Offer alternative solutions to the problem or reduce your request. Focus on what will work to solve the issue. You may even turn the table table-darks by saying, “What do you think we should do here?” <br> Don’t respond when people try to verbally threaten or attack you. Don’t let that distract you from making your point. Walk away if you have to. <br> Practice interpersonal interactions. It’s the only way to get better at reacting and responding to other people. For example, while talking with someone, change the subject. You could also try asking your counselor for a favor, respectfully disagree with someone’s opinion, or ask a person to stop doing something that bothers you. <br> Don’t be afraid to use a little humor. Smile. Be light-hearted. But, make sure you don’t use offending humor that would upset people, like anything related to race, homosexuality, mental illness, etc.",

He has a long history of bad relationships that quickly go from love to hate. He got married at an early age. Stephen and his wife argued a lot. As a result, he would often move in and out of their home depending on how bad things got until they finally divorced. He married again not long after that, and the same pattern unfolded. Stephen gets jealous easily and needs a lot of attention to feel loved. But, he never spoke about his jealousy problems or need for attention. He felt that his romantic partners should just know when something was wrong with him. It made him feel weak and stupid to have to tell people about his emotions. Stephen is incarcerated for domestic violence. He got so upset with his current wife for having lunch with a male co-worker to discuss a possible promotion that he let his anger get out of control. He beat her, breaking several ribs and causing bruises all over her body. His wife filed for divorce. Stephen is now in a treatment group for inmates with domestic violence convictions. The other group members don’t like Stephen because he’s very frustrating and confusing. One minute he’s praising the other group members and the counselor for their hard work (usually when Stephen is the focus of attention), and the next minute he is on a tangent about how much of an idiot everyone is (usually when he is not the center of attention). He never seems to share any deeper emotions or clearly communicate how he’s feeling. Stephen makes other people feel like they need to walk on eggshells. He keeps coming to the group, but he is afraid to ask the other members for help with his real problems.\" </i>",

These wrong messages result in certain symptoms (depression, anxiety, hallucinations, delusions, loss of focus). This is where some medications can be helpful because they try toput your neurotransmitters back in order so they communicate the right messages again. As a result, you can think more clearly.
