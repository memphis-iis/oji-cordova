  "description": "If you are completing this next module, it likely means you experienced some form of suicidal thinking or behavior before. This module can be mentally difficult for some people because it asks about troubling ideas. If you experience any thoughts about hurting yourself, call a trusted friend, your supervision officer, or dial 988 for a 24-hour crisis hotline. If you’re nervous, it’s ok. Start whenever you’re ready. ",

      "text": "People think about suicide (the purposeful act of killing oneself) when they feel unbearable emotional pain in their minds or conscience. This feeling is called Psychache (like a headache or heartache causes pain to your head or heart). There are things about your history (even your family history), your mood, and the ways you handle stress that put you at greater risk for suicide. There are also things about your environment – such as being back in the community after being in jail or prison – that can add to your risk. In fact, in 2014 more than 13% of probationers in one state alone were at high risk for suicide, and women were twice as likely to experience suicidal ideations. People who have a strong intent to commit suicide and who have easy access to materials that can be lethal (guns, sharp objects, rope, drugs) are likely to succeed at dying.",

Your level of suicide risk depends not only on the number of risk factors – such as having a suicide history, negative emotions, environmental stress, or access to sharp objects – but also on the severity of these factors (how bad are they?). There are two specific categories of feelings that, along with some of the risk factors mentioned earlier, are believed to increase the likelihood of suicidal behavior. Researchers have fancy names for these feelings: (1) Thwarted Belongingness and (2) Perceived Burdensomeness. See the figure below. Remember: There is hope. You can take charge of your life and make positive changes, even if you are under community supervision.",

Self-harm is anything a person does to intentionally cause injury to himself, such as cutting or burning the skin (arms, wrist, legs), choking the neck area, pulling out hair, or head-banging. There are many different reasons why people engage in SIB. For example, someone who causes self-injury, but does not want to die, may be trying to seek help for his struggles, punish or get back at others, fit in/belong to a group, or gain attention. This is called non-suicidal self injury. It can be stressful getting used to the outside world again, so wanting help, being angry with other people, or trying to fit in are common feelings. But, you have other skills you can use that don’t involve hurting yourself. Self-injury can be dangerous whether you intend to kill yourself or not – it can result in physical disability, disfigurement, scars, brain damage, or accidental death.",

Once, Janet even convinced her mother to drive her to buy a new supply of heroin. She said she needed a ride to a job interview – that was a lie. Janet was arrested when she sold $500 worth of heroin to an undercover cop. She was booked into the prison and began experiencing withdrawal symptoms from her heroin use. Janet felt frustrated by her situation and decided to smuggle in a pencil from the intake process. She dug the pencil point deep into her arms, causing bleeding. She made sure the nursing staff saw her wounds, and they did. She was soon transferred to a psychiatric hospital to get help. Janet escaped from the hospital.
