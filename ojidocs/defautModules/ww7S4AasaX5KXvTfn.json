      "text": "Most counties, if not all, have a community corrections supervision department. You may know this as your probation or parole office. It can look a lot like a police department. Some supervision officers (also called Community Corrections Officers or CCOs, Probation Officers, Parole Officer, POs) may even have special uniformsor a badge.But,they have different responsibilities and prioritiesthan cops. In the same way that you have priorities and goals, community supervision officers make sure that released offenders (or supervisees) like you are choosing a law-abiding lifestyleand following the terms of theirsupervision. To do this, officers oversee caseloads of supervisees. You are just one person on what could be a very large caseload for yourassigned supervising officer. This meansthat, not only must your officer keep track of you and investigateany concerns he may haveabout you, but he must also do this for everyone else on hiscaseload. Supervisors may also have a role in assessing your treatment needs or even arrangingyour participation in treatment.To make all of these things happen, they spend their days driving around the community meeting their supervisees at their homes, work, treatment facilities,and at the supervision department office. They work hard to find resources such as free or low-cost mental health treatment, vouchers for identification cards,and bus passes.So, next time you see your officer and she’s a bit cranky, maybe cut her some slack! <br> The following is a sample job description for a Community Corrections Officers, according to the Society of Human Resource Management: <br> \"To perform casework services in a designated area (such as probation/parole investigation, supervision and treatment; institutional treatment, custody and program operation; crime victim restitution; community referrals, court diversion programs; domestic relations and domestic abuse services; or other community corrections area) in order to carry out court orders, state correction directives or departmental programs for community corrections services; and to perform related duties assigned.\" <br> And some specific duties include (from www.correctionalofficer.org): <ul><li> Regular interviews with offenders to monitor program progress and compliance </li><li> Administration of urinalysis drug screenings </li><li> In-home checkups on select occasions </li><li> Documented assessment of parole or probation subject for presentation to the court </li><li> Arrangement of community service hours to satisfy program requirements </li><li> Ensuring offender attendance at treatment, assessment or educational programs </li><li> Investigation of offenders suspected to be violating terms of parole or probation </li><li> Coordination with local law enforcement when violations occur </li></ul> ",

      "text": "Community Supervision officers are different from police officers and correctional officers in jail or prison because they wear two different hats. In other words, they have two different responsibilities that are both important, but do not always get along. Community supervision officers are responsible for helping their supervisee to get treatment and live a law-abiding life, and also enforce supervision rules and restrictions. This can get frustrating for you because one day your supervising officer may be signingyou up for treatment programs and helping you get your ID, and other days they may be drilling you with questions about your friends and why you don't have a job yet. Or pressing you to pay your fees. You will wish that they would just make up their mind,are they are on your side or not?! <br> Think of a time when you held conflicting responsibilities—when you had to do two things that felt opposite of each other. Here’s an example: it's hard to feel like a good parent when you have to work to support your kid, and don't have enough time to spend with them. Or, in your darker past, it was probably hard to steal from your parents so you could pay back a debt. <br> When you feel like your community supervision officer is on your case about work, who you spend time with, and other life choices, try to remember that they are wearing two big hats, and that both hats are necessary to help you be successful while also keeping the public safe. They want to help you meet your personal goals so you stay out of the courtroom for violation hearings or worse, behind bars.",

      "text": "Not all supervising officers choose their career thinking they willhelp people who have a mental illness. But research shows that a large amount of people who are on community supervision also have a mental illnessor symptoms of a mental illness. Many probation offices are nowproviding extensive training to officers so they know how to best help people who have a mental illness while on supervision. <br> Some departments even have community supervision officers who only work with supervisees who have mental health needs (they may be part of a special mental health docket or court). These officers have more training in mental health and are taught to use a different set of problem-solving strategies with their supervisees than traditional community supervision departments. Specialized mental health officers and courts have a greater understanding about the resources in the community that can help people with mental illness. Rather than using probation violations and setting restrictions when supervisees are having difficulty, they try to first understand how mental illness may have played a role in their behavior. This helps people stay out of trouble when they are struggling to manage their mental illness. <br> But, this doesn’t mean mental health dockets are an easier road or that you will be cut any slack. Working with a supervising officer who specializes in mental health also comes with extra responsibility because they will expect you to work on improving your mental health, participate in treatment, stay sober, and take your medications as part of your supervision rules. And, you will have regular contact with the judge of the mental health court. In other words, you get more help, but you also have more eyes on you, and you can still get in trouble if you refuse to do these things! You can always help officers understand your problems by respectfully informing them about the symptoms of your specific mental illness or treatment needs and what you are doing to manage them. If you aren't sure whether you are part of a mental health court, ask your officer. You could also be on drug court, veterans court, or another specialized caseload. ",

Most officers truly are invested in your well-being and are rooting for you to do better. Imagine spending your day going to court, talking about how well your supervisees are doing, fighting for their privileges on supervision, and really caring about their success only to have them hate you, threaten you, and skip supervision visits because they think \"I'll teach him to get in my business.\" When you don’t do what you’re supposed to do, your supervising officer then, by law, has to put more restrictions on, or maybe even violate, you. This can be disheartening for them when their supervisees were doing so well just the day before. And that’s all in one day's work! <br> There are so many different scenarios that officers find themselves in when supervisees don’t take their community supervision seriously and violate the rules. They may spend days trying to track down a supervisee who has stopped calling them, even going into to neighborhoods or other situations that are unsafe. What would you do in that situation? How would you feel when you left work each day? How long do you think you could last in a job like that? Supervising officers get tired of dealing with the tough decisions they have to make; it’s easy to get emotionally and physically exhausted. And it can feel like they’re working for someone who doesn’t even care about themselves. <br> People who work with offenders are at a high risk for extreme stress and negative feelings about their work, pushing a lot of supervising officers to quit their jobs early or to stay in their jobs for the wrong reasons. When supervision department are short-staffed, it can cause a lot of stress and stain across the department. And, as you know, stress can also cause significant health problems. This goes without mentioning the risk they already take on in their jobs, such as community violence or being attacked by supervisees who are not living a law-abiding life.

Model citizens are often seen as “weak” or a “kiss-ass.” The mindset is typically that officers are “on the other side” or represent “the system.” In other words, there is an “us vs. them” mentality that leads to conflicts and assaults on officers, not to mention a failure to follow rules of supervision. Some people take joy in harassing officers and like to play mind games to see how much stuff they can get away with. But, think about what happens when people mess with you? How do you respond? It’s harder to be nice, isn’t it? Officers are humans, too, so remember that when they are stressed and burnt out, they’re going to have a much harder time treating you nicely or granting privileges. When you’re denied privileges, you’re at risk for criminalness. <br> Think about the criminal thinking style of Power Orientation. Was this one of your common errors? If so, you may want to pay attention to how you interact with your supervising officer. Do you tend to undermine or undercut them? Talk down to them? Tell them that they are worthless, stupid, or a motherfucker? Do you like to argue with your supervising officer to gain control or privileges? These behaviors place you at high risk for disciplinary reports and even supervision violations, which could put you back in jail. Being in a tug of war with your officer, whose job is to help you, never ends well for anyone. You will either get in trouble or be seriously hurt. <br> It’s also important to remember that criminal attitudes are a risk factor for future crime. So, if you think things like, \"officers are more corrupt than half their supervisees,\" then you are likely high on this risk factor. What do these thoughts do for you? Are they helpful? Usually not. Having a bad attitude toward authority decreases your desire to follow the rules, and not following the rules will land you in hot water. Try acting opposite to reverse some of your negative attitudes toward the people in positions to enforce the rules of the facility and keep everyone safe.",

You might disagree on supervision rules, curfew times, whether you are being truthful, or if your supervising officer is trying to screw you over. These disagreements are hard to solve because it’s your word over theirs, and you have a lot on the line: if you don’t keep your cool, your supervising officer could put more restrictions on you or even violate you! <br> So how do you keep your cool when you disagree with your supervising officer? Think back to Worksheet 4 Module 4, where you learned the Conflict Resolution Model. Hopefully you’ve been practicing this since then. How can you apply those five steps to resolving conflict with your supervising officer? Below are some additional conflict resolution skills that can help you resolve disagreements between you and your officer. <br> \"I\" statements begin with the word \"I.\" In using \"I\" statements, you talk specifically about yourself, not the person with whom you disagree. Using sentences that focus on you instead of the other person will help you communicate how you feel and what you need without making the other person feel attacked or making you look like you are avoiding responsibility. Here is an example of a conflict and an \"I\" statement you could use to communicate your feelings and needs to your supervising officer: <br><i> Your old drug dealer surprised you at your apartment – he tells you he has a ton of business right now and is willing to pay you some big cash if you help him make a few deals tonight. He brought drugs into your apartment to show you everything he’s got. Then your supervising officer knocks on your door for a random visit. You open the door, and he sees who you’re with – and what he’s put on your kitchen table table-dark. Your officer grills you about who the friend is, and asks how you have been passing your urinalysis tests if you’ve been doing drugs this whole time. </i> <br><b>How would this likely make you feel? </b>Upset. My officer obviously does not trust me. He came in at a bad time and it's going to ruin my entire probation. <br><b> What would you need from the officer in this situation? </b> I wish he would just calm the hell down so I can explain myself. I didn't even want this guy over. <br><b> Make an \"I\" statement that communicates your feelings and needs. </b> It makes me upset that you think I have been faking my clean urinalysis tests. I need you to please be patient and allow me to explain the situation before we talk more. Can we do that? <br> You also want to be aware of your tone, even when using \"I\" statements.

Here are some strategies that you are familiar with: <br><ul><li> First, check to see what role you played in the situation. Are you resisting orders or did you give the officer some other reason to treat you the way you’ve been treated? Did your behavior deserve the actions of the officer? Remember that their role is to make sure safety comes first. If this is hard for you to think about, think for a moment how you would feel if the roles were reversed. </li><li> Use cognitive restructuring – for example, tell yourself that the officer’s behavior probably has nothing to do with you; she has a stressful job and this may be the way she knows how to cope with it. Think about the consequences of letting your anger get the best of you. </li><li> Use thought stopping – stop yourself from thinking about \"getting even\" or seeking revenge on the officer. </li><li> Act opposite – pretend to be polite and friendly, even if that’s not how you feel at the moment (but, make sure you don’t come off like a smartass!) </li><li> Use positive self-talk – tell yourself that you can handle the situation, the officer isn’t allowed to hurt you unless you pose a danger to him or another person; tell yourself that you have the ability to calm down and follow the officer’s instructions. </li><li> Use your conflict resolution skills – be assertive (but respectful) and try to talk to the officer about how her attitude toward you is making you feel or how it’s contributing to your stress or mental health symptoms. This may come as a surprise to staff because most supervisees won’t take the time to express their feelings. </li><li> Don’t react other than to do what you’re asked – sometimes people who seek power act like assholes to get a reaction from you (like fear or aggression), and when they no longer get a reaction, they stop. So, don’t react as if you’re scared or ready to fight; this may be what they want. Just follow the basic order you were given, whether it’s to do a drug test or wait in the hall while your officer speaks to his supervisor. They may be looking for a reason to violate you, but you don’t have to give them the satisfaction. </li><li> If an officer is truly targeting you, you may file a complaint with the department. Check what the procedures for doing this are at your community supervision office. But, try one of the other steps first. You don’t want to be the person who files complaints for every little thing. </li></ul><br> Remember that most supervising officers are not like this. In fact, studies have shown that, even though the public and policy-makers strongly support punishment for people who have committed crimes, most staff in the criminal system, like correctional officers do not share this view and actually support rehabilitation and treatment programs for people in the system. Supervising officers are even expected to help you put your life back together as part of their job. So, in the end, they really are on your side!"
