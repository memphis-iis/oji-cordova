You broke a state or federal law, and your time under supervisionis part of your punishment. Criminalnessis more than doing crime or thinking about crime; it is any behavior that shows irresponsibility and does not consider the rights, well-being, or welfare of other people or yourself. Some types of criminalness cannot be punished by the courts but they still have consequences for you and those around you. Criminalness is offensive, whether it is legal or not.It could range from calling off sick from work when you aren’t really sick (therefore, putting more responsibility on others) to committing a very serious felony.",

A return to criminal conduct is called Criminal Recidivism(think of “recidivism” as a return –it could be a return to jail, prison, or to supervision). Criminal recidivism is a big problem; about 70% of all offenders commit more crimes once released from a correctional facility. This is because they don’t manage their criminalness(and for some people, symptoms of mental illness). Having an awareness of what thoughts, feelings, and behaviors build up to or contribute to your criminalnessallows you tocreate and followa clear plan to recognize them when they happen and stop them from causing problems and distracting you from your goals",

      "text": "These factors have been identified by researchers as the most likely to lead to higher levels of criminalness and further involvement in crime or rule-violating behaviors. <ul><li><b>Criminal Thinking:</b> There are different ways of thinking about your world and the people in it. Criminals are more likely to think in ways that support negative behaviors than the average person. As you can guess, criminal thinking is very common in prisons and for people on community supervision. But, it's this kind of thinking that keeps you in trouble. At the beginning of Oji's Journey, you were assessed on your go-to styles of criminal thinking. Once you know yours, you can challenge them with more helpful ways of thinking. Ask your counselor or supervising officer about your results of the Psychological Inventory of Criminal Thinking Style (or the PICTS). </li><li><b>Criminal Associates:</b>Criminals who talk to and hang around other criminals are at a high risk for crime. This is a problem in parole and probation because EVERYONE is a criminal. So, who <i>can</i> you associate with? Find friends, neighbors, or co-workers who are following the rules. They exist! You will learn more about forming new relationships in Module 7.</li><li><b>Family or Relationship Problems:</b> If you have family members in your circle who are supportive and willing to help with your goals, use them as a resource. Talking to your family about your goals helps you remember what you're working towards. In addition, other people can keep you in-check and challenge you when you do something that's against your goals. On the other hand, if you have family who do not support you or who are engaging in crime, staying in touch with them could increase your risk for bad behavior. Is it worth it to patch things up or simply move on? More on this in Module 7.</li><li><b>Poor School and Work Achievement:</b> People with academic and legitimate (legal) work interests are less likely to be involved in crime. School and work increase productivity and give you something helpful to focus on, so you are not tempted to behave poorly. in the community, you can enroll in GED classes, community college, or other training programs, or apply for jobs that might interest you. We'll talk about work issues in Module 8.</li><li><b>Lack of Prosocial Free Time and Recreational Activities:</b> You heard in Module 2 that free time, or unplanned leisure time, is bad news. When you get bored, you try to stir up some excitement. That excitement get you into trouble. Just like school and work, staying active and using your spare time wisely will keep you occupied. This will give you less time to think about breaking the rules. You have already identified some things you can do in the community to stay busy. This may seem less important, but don't skip it!</li><li><b>Substance Abuse:</b> Using drugs leads to high criminalness and crime in several ways. First, using drugs or alcoholic substances is a violation of your supervision terms. And, drug use in general is often illegal. So, being caught with drugs will likely add time to your supervision or earn you a free ticket to jail. Second, using these substances reduced your ability to think clearly or make good decisions. They make you more impulsive and lose sight of your goals. Go to AA or NA if this is a problem for you and find people who are actually working the program. </li><li><b>Failing to Cope with Mental Illness or Negative Emotions: </b> Some people experience symptoms of mental illness. If this is true for you, you'll learn about this in a separate module. Uncontrolled symptoms of mental illness or negative emotions can place people at a greater risk for crime and rule-violating behaviors. This is because mental illness that is not treated can lead to bad decisions, impulsivity, anger and aggression, suicidal intent, or a loss of interest in accomplishing healthy goals. All of these things can lead to behaviors that threaten your safety or the safety of others. So, if you take medication for this purpose, take them as prescribed and continue working hard in this program (even when things feel difficult). Please be aware, people with mental illnesses are NOT dangerous - this is a myth. However, when people have mental illnesses <i>and</i> are prone to criminalness, both parts need to be a focus of treatment. </li></ul> ",

      "text": "Offenders think differently than non-offenders. You think like other criminals and, as a result, you are high on criminalness. Criminal thinking does not mean that you think about crime all the time. Rather, you have a set of core thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs that support criminalness and rule-breaking behavior. Below is a list of the 8 styles of thinking that are likely to place you at high risk for criminal recidivism and returning to jail. <ul><li><b>Mollification</b>: is a tendency to blame others or your situation (e.g., family, poverty, discrimination) for your criminalness without thinking about your role. Examples include “I wouldn’t have to resort to crime if people like me were treated fairly,” or “if my mom wasn’t so crazy, I wouldn’t be like this.” This doesn’t mean other things in your life aren’t contributing to your problems, but it’s irresponsible not to consider your own choices. People often use mollification to avoid feeling guilty about irresponsible actions. </li><li>     <b>Cutoff:</b> is a style of thinking that supports acting impulsively to get what you want regardless of the consequences to you or others. People under community supervision often do what they want, when they want, and how they want. Statements such as “to hell with it,” “this is not worth my time,” or “fuck it,” suggest a refusal to do what is right or best. </li><li>     <b>Entitlement: </b> occurs when you give yourself permission to break the law, harm others, or avoid other responsible behavior because of a sense of ownership, privilege, or uniqueness. For example, someone who was fired from their job might believe they are “owed” a debt rather than considering what behaviors led to their firing. People high on entitlement believe they should be allowed to do and take what they want (e.g., drugs, women, money). </li><li>      <b>Power Orientation:</b> is a craving for power and control to boost your own standing. This can include outward displays of aggression to manipulate others. If you have ever put someone else down to feel better about yourself, you have used power orientation. Behavior rooted in this type of thinking is intended to avoid negative feelings about yourself. </li><li>     <b>Sentimentality:</b> is the belief that doing something good or nice makes up for doing something bad or harmful. Bringing flowers to your partner after giving them a black eye is an example of sentimentality. People engage in this thinking style to avoid feeling bad about their past behaviors or recognizing the scope of harm that is caused when their criminalness is not properly managed. </li><li>     <b>Superoptimism:</b> is the belief you will be able to avoid negative outcomes of your criminalness. The notion that you are “too smart to get caught again” or “are better able to manage mental health symptoms without medication” are examples of superoptimism. Eventually this type of thinking will derail your recovery or re-entry. </li><li>     <b>Cognitive Indolence:</b> is a fancy word for taking a lazy approach to dealing with your problems. Rather than effectively working through problems, people who think like this look for the easy way around problems. Examples include selling stolen property during a time of financial need, getting high when faced with life stressors, or skipping a therapy session because it’s an inconvenience. Sometimes people work harder to get out of something than they would if they simply worked to solve the problem! </li><li>      <b>Discontinuity:</b> is the tendency to lose sight of your personal goals by focusing on more immediate rewards or gratification. People on community supervision may say things like, “I got side-tracked” or “I thought I could handle one beer.” This loss of focus can have significant long-term consequences for you recovery and re-entry. If you stick to your goals, you will experience even bigger rewards in good time.</li></ul> ",

Recovering from the flu, for example, means that you are working to stop your symptoms completely; you take medications, eat soup, and rest easy so you canbe cured of the disease. Recovery from criminalness is different. You are not working to cure it or make it go away forever. It is about controlling parts of your life that are not good for you or lead you to trouble.You must ALWAYS work toward recovery;if you stop, you will likely go back to where you started in the first place. This is true even if you are starting to have more successes in your life. Improvement does not mean you stop working on your recovery; it just means that you are doing all the right things and that you must continueto do those things. Don’t stop! Your goals will help you figure out what recovery means for you. For example, if Sally’s goal is to have more close and supportive relationships with other people, then recovery for her is when she is able to find and hold on to those kinds of relationships.

Here are some tips that help people meet their recovery goals: <ul><li><b>Believing that goals - whether big or small - are very important. </b> Make it a priority to achieve your goals. Don't be embarrassed, ashamed, or afraid of your goals. They're yours, so own them. </li><li><b> Writing down goals to keep you on track. </b> Having goals written down somewhere serves as a constant reminder. You can look at them when you need a boost. You can also write down some motivational statements to keep you going. </li><li><b> Keeping in mind what is really important to you, like completing community supervision without further problems.</b> Reminding yourself about the good things you can have by changing, pushes you to move forward. </li><li><b> Becoming involved in treatment or self-help groups. </b> This may actually be mandated for you, but even if it's not, see what's out there and get involved. Talking to other people with similar problems or concerns makes you feel more comfortable talking about your own struggles as a returning citizen. The more you talk about it, the more you learn about yourself. Groups also help you to improve your social skills and give you the change to help others in need. </li><li><b> Staying active, like working out. </b> Physical activity makes your body produce natural chemicals that make you feel good. It's always a way to fill up free time so you don't get bored or do something unproductive. </li><li><b> Finding social supports - people who are following the rules and doing pro-social things. </b> Support systems can include family, doctors, counselors. supervision officers, your lawyer, a religious person, or anyone else you trust. Share your challenges and goals with these people so they can keep an eye on you. Sometimes other people are able to notice things you can't see. Give them permission to tell you when you're getting distracted from your goals. </li><li><b> Being aware of your warning signs (yellow) and triggers (red) - things that threaten your recovery. </b> Knowing what these risk factors are helps you to avoid them in the future of prepare to handle them better when you can't avoid them. What makes you angry? Sad? Violent? Out of control? </li><li><b> Using creativity to express yourself. </b> Sometimes you may feel that no one understands you or that you can't put how you really feel into words. Instead of letting it bottle up and explode later, get creative! Act it out, write a poem, or draw scribbles and doodles. This will help you get your emotions out there and will give you a unique way to talk about it later. </li><li><b> Following through with a plan of action! </b> This is SO important. Treatment is no help at all if you don't continue to use the skills you learn. Make a plan. Decide for yourself what you need to do on your road to recovery, such as (1) what risks do you need to take, (2) what challenges should you be aware of, (3) how will you deal with those challenges when they come up, and (4) who can you count on to help you? Stick to it! This is something you can have control over. </li></ul>",

Once you see that you are at risk, you can actright away. So, what you need to do is trace the steps that will lead to your relapse if you stop working on your recovery. That is, what people, places, environments, behaviors, feelings, or thoughts will likely come BEFORE your relapseinto crime or further criminalness? These are the things you need to avoid or learn to deal with if you encounter them. Think back to your history–what path originally led you to the behaviors you’ve been trying to change now? The earlier you can catch your risks,the more likely you will be to prevent it from becoming a full relapse. It’s easier to escape a shark attack if you are in the shallow part of the ocean; it becomes a lot more difficult to get out the deeper you go. <br>Here's an example of what the path to relapse might look like:</br><ul><li><b>Warning Sign: </b> You start to feel like life isn't fair</li><li><b>Trigger:</b> Someone cuts you off at an intersection</li><li><b>Relapse:</b> You get into a physical altercation</li></ul> Triggers come directly before a relapse. Think of a trigger on a gun - if you pull it, the action happens immediately: BOOM. Warning signs come before the trigger. In other words, warning signs are like the shallow part of the ocean; triggers are the deeper part. So, it is easier to stop relapse at the warning signs but not impossible at the triggers. It's also important to know that everyone has different warning signs and triggers. For example, a beer commercial showing sexy women and a fun party might be a trigger for one man, who walks immediately to the corner store and relapses with a 12-pack. For another man, this commercial may be a warning sign that gets him to think about how relaxing a cold beer would be right now. For other people, this commercial may be neither a warning sign nor a trigger. ",

People with mental illnesses and people who are high on criminalness have a hard time responding to stress. Stressis a feeling of pressure, strain, or tension. Stress can be good for you or bad for you. It can come from a negative event or situation (like losing a job, being incarcerated) or from a positive event or situation (being released from prison, starting a new relationship). Stress happens to everyone, but it’s all about how you deal with it that matters. For example, it’s normal to feel stressed out about being in restricted housing because it is not a pleasant or fun place to be. But, if your mental illness or criminalness gets in the way of your ability to cope with stress, you will feel out of control, and your symptoms will get worse. You will move away from your goals and will be at risk for relapse. So, stress is a RED light for both your mental illness and your criminalness.

The better you get at lessening your stress, the more you increase your chances of reaching your personal goals. You are responsible for actively coping with stress. Don’t wait for someone else to tell you to do it. <br> What can you do to deal with your stress? These actions may help stop you from getting stressed out and moving away from your goals. Try them all at least once: <ul><li><b>Being aware of situations that cause you stress. </b> Check this one off because you've already started doing this. Knowing about these situations ahead of time allows you to plan out different ways for handling the situation when it comes up again. You can better prepare for it. Or, do your best to avoid the situation altogether.</li><li><b> Do things you like to do (whenever possible).</b> To the best of your ability, do activities that you enjoy like writing, drawing, reading, or meditating. Go back to your activities log for help. But, make sure these activities don't get in the way of other important responsibilities, such as going your homework for this program or attending meetings with your SO</li><li><b> Relax.</b> You have a lot of stress and pressure on you right now, so relaxing may sound near impossible. But, give it a go anyway. Go back and review Progressive Muscle Relaxation steps and Guided Imagery. These strategies can help you calm down. </li><li><b>Build a social support system. </b> This is not a new idea; you've heard this already. But again, find people who will listen to you when you're stressed and help you work through your problems. These people could be your counselor, other supervisees who are doing well, family members who you can spend time with, a treatment group, or a religious/spiritual leader. Do not ask for help from people who will you down or criticize you, who get into trouble or break the law, or who are not focused on their own recovery. This will only make your stress worse. </li><li><b> Take care of your health. </b> When your body is healthy, you have more strength to deal with stress. So, don't skip meals, don't skip time at the gym (even if you feel rushed), don't skip you medications if needed, don't skip showers, and keep a regular sleep schedule. </li><li><b> Talk about your feelings somehow. </b> Most people don't like to talk about their feelings. Although holding in feelings is the common code among inmates and then supervisees (you might have said, \"It's nobody's business\" or \"I'm going to do it on my own time\"), it is very stressful to keep things bottled in. It's like blowing up a balloon. If you keep filling it with hot air, it will soon burst, and all the air will come gushing out - quickly and out of control. Talk to your social support network. Or, if you're not comfortable yet talking about your feelings or don't know how to talk about your feelings, get creative (write them down or draw them out). Other supervisees or treatment group members may try to make you feel bad or stupid for talking about your feelings but remember where they are!</li><li><b> Know that you will make mistakes and be ok with that. </b> You are human. You will goof up every now and then; that's all part of the process So, don't get too bent out of shape. The important part is that you LEARN from the mistake, so you can avoid making it in the future. Don't just say, \"oh well\" and forget about it. Trace your steps; how did you get to the mistake? What should you do differently next time? Mistakes could be failing to take your medications as prescribed, engaging in criminalness (but, let's hope not illegal stuff), or not working in your treatment program. Commit to doing better the next time around. </li></ul>",

Not all exercises will work as well for you as they do for some other people but try them all a few times so you can decide which ones work best for you. <br><b> Deep Breathing </b><ul><li> Lie down on your bed or on the floor. Bend your knees and move your feet about eight inches apart with your toes turner slightly outward. Make sure that your spine is straight and flat. </li><li> Check your body for tension. Feel where the tension is in your body. </li><li> Put one hand on your stomach and one hand on your chest. </li><li> Breathe in slowly and deeply through your nose into your stomach to push up your hand as much as feels comfortable. Your chest should move only a little and only with your stomach. </li><li> When you feel comfortable with the previous step, smile slightly and breathe in through your nose and breathe out through your mouth, making a quiet, relaxing, whooshing sound like the wind as you blow gently out. Your mouth, tongue, and jaw will be relaxed. Take long, slow, deep breaths that raise and lower your stomach. Focus on the sound and feeling of your breathing as you become more and more relaxed. </li><li> Continue this deep breathing for about five or ten minutes at a time, once or twice a day. Then, if you like, gradually extend this period to twenty minutes as you practice more. </li><li> At the end of each deep-breathing session, take a little time to once again check your body for tension. Compare the tension you feel at the conclusion of the exercise with that which you experienced when you began. </li><li> When you become comfortable with breathing into your stomach, practice it any time during the day when you feel like it while sitting down or standing still. Focus on your stomach moving up and down, the air moving in and out of your lungs, and the feelings of relaxation that deep breathing gives you. </li></ul><br><b>Counting Your Breaths</b><ul><li> Sit or lie in a comfortable position with your arms and legs uncrossed and your spine straight and flat. </li><li> Breathe deeply into your stomach. Let yourself pause for a few seconds before you breathe out. </li><li> As you breathe out, count \"one\" to yourself. As you continue to breathe in and out, count each time you release your breath: \"Two...Three...Four.\" Continue this for about 10 minutes. </li><li> Notice your breathing, your body relaxing, and your mind calming as you practice this exercise. </li></ul><br><b> Letting Go of Tension <ul><li> Sit comfortably with your feet on the floor. </li><li> Breathe in deeply into your stomach and say silently to yourself, \"Breathe in relaxation.\" Let yourself pause before you let go of your breath. </li><li> Breathe out from your stomach and say silently to yourself, \"Breathe out tension.\" Pause before you breathe in again. </li><li> Each time you breathe in, use this as a moment to become aware of any tension in your body. </li><li> Each time you breathe out, use this as an opportunity to let go of tension. </li><li> You may find it helpful to use your imagination to see or feel the relaxation entering and the tension leaving your body. </li></ul>",

So, stick with it. <br><b>Quick Procedure</b><br> Once you have mastered the basic procedure, use the following procedure to relax your muscles quickly. Whole muscle groups are simultaneously tensed and then relaxed. As before, repeat each procedure at lease once, tensing each muscle group from 5 to 7 seconds and then relaxing them form fifteen to thirty seconds. Remember to notice the differences between the sensations of tension and relaxation. <ul><li> Curl both fists, tightening biceps and forearms. Relax. </li><li> Roll your head around on your neck in a complete circle, and then reverse directions. Relax. </li><li> Wrinkle up the muscles of your face like a walnut: forehead wrinkled, eyes squinted, mouth open. and shoulders hunched.

Here is another way to think about it in more detail. <b>Creating an Imaginary Special Place</b><br> In creating your special place, you will make an imaginary retreat for relaxation and guidance. This place may be indoors or out. In structuring your place, follow a few guidelines: <ul><li> Make your place peaceful, comfortable, and safe.</li><li>Fill you place with lots of different sensations. Create a mid-ground, foreground, and a background n your place. <br> Your special place might be at the end of a path that leads to a pond. Grass is under your feet, the pond is about thirty feet away, and mountains are in the distance. You can feel the coolness of the air in this shady spot. A bird is singing. The sun is bright on the pond. The flower's pungent odor attracts the bee buzzing over the flower with its sweet nectar. <br> Or, your special place might be a sparkling-clean kitchen, where there are cinnamon buns baking in the oven. Through the kitchen window you can see fields of yellow wheat. Fresh laundry flutters in the breeze. At the table is a cup of tea for your guest. <li> Allow room for an inner guide or other person to comfortably be with you. </li><b> Going to Your Special Place</b><li>To go to your safe place, lie down and be totally comfortable.</li><li> Close your eyes and walk slowly to a quiet place in your mind. Your place can be inside or outside; it just needs to be peaceful and safe. </li><li> Picture yourself unloading your anxieties and worries. </li><li> Notice the view in the distance...What do you smell?...What do you hear?...Notice what is before you...Reach out and touch it...How does it feel?...Smell it...Hear it...Make the temperature comfortable...Be safe here. </li><li>Look around for a special spot, a private spot...Find the path to this place...Feel the ground with your feet...Look above you...What do you see?...Hear?...Smell?...Walk down this path until you can enter your own quiet, comfortable, safe place. </li><li> You have arrived at your special place...What is under your feet?...How does it feel?...Take several steps...What do you see above you?...What do you hear?...Do you hear something else?</li><li> Reach out and touch something...What is the texture? Are there pens, paper, paints nearby, or is there sand to draw in, clay to work? Go to them, handle them, smell them. These are your special tools, or tools for your inner guide to reveal ideas or feelings to you. </li><li> Look as far as you can see...What do you see? What do you hear? What aromas do you notice? </li><li> Sit or lie in your special place...Notice its smells, sounds, sights...This is your place, and nothing can harm you here...If danger is here, tell it to leave. </li><li> Spend three to five minutes realizing you are relaxed, safe, and comfortable. </li><li> Memorize this place's smells, tastes, sights, sounds...You can come back and relax here whenever you want...Leave by the same path or entrance...Notice the ground, touch the things near you...Look far away and appreciate the view...Remind yourself this special place you created can be entered whenever you want wish. Say an affirmation such as, \"I can relax here\" or \"This is my special place. I can come here whenever I wish.\" </li><li> Now open your eyes and spend a few minutes appreciating your relaxation. </li></ul>",

      "text": "Sometimes when you are stressed, your mind will start to get worked up and wander all over the place.That is, you have negative automatic thoughts in response to a stressful situation. Many people feel that they are much worse at things than they really are or that their situation is much worse than it really is. So, people will make themselves feel bad. This is called negative self-talk. And it’s not helpful. One way to deal with this kind of stress is to start talking yourself back down to reality again using positive self-talk. Have a conversation with yourself. It helps to think about what you might say to yourself when negative self-talk happens to you. You’ve had some practice with positive self-talk before. But, here are some other ideas. <br><b> Steps for Positive Self-Talk</b><ul><li> Notice when you are becoming tense. </li><li> Pay attention to what you are currently thinking. Decide if these thoughts are good and true or if they are negative self-talk such as \"I am not good at anything\" or \"Nobody that I know likes me.\" </li><li> Clear your mind of these thoughts and replace them with thoughts from the list below. </li><li> Repeat these thoughts until you start to feel better. </ul></li> <b> List of Positive Self-Talk Thoughts </b> <ul><li> Take a deep breath and relax. </li><li> Getting upset won't help.</li><li> Just as long as I keep my cool, I'm in control. </li><li> Easy does it...There's nothing to be gained from getting mad. </li><li> I'm not going to let him/her get to me. </li><li> I can't change him/her with anger or by freaking out; I'll just upset myself. </li><li> I can find a way to say what I want without anger. </li><li> Stay calm - no sarcasm, no verbal attacks. </li><li> His/her opinion isn't important. I won't be pushed into losing my cool. </li><li> It's just a hassle. Nothing more, nothing less. I can deal with hassles. </li><li> Break the problem down. Anger often comes from lumping things together. </li><li> Just because someone said \"no\" to my request doesn't mean I should not have asked in the first place. </li><li> I'm getting better at this anger management stuff. </li><li> I got angry but kept the lid on saying stupid things. That's progress. </li><li> Stress means that it's time to relax and cope. </li><li> I can manage this; I'm in control. </li><li> No one is right; no one is wrong. We just have different needs or ideas. </li><li> I don't like when people judge me, so I shouldn't judge them. </li><li> No matter what is said, I know I'm a good person. </li><li> I'll stay rational; anger won't solve anything. </li><li> Let them look foolish and upset. I can stay cool and calm. </li><li> I can stand it if I don't get what I need or want. </li><li> If they want me to get angry (or stressed out), I'm going to disappoint them. </li><li> There is no law that says other peoples' opinions are more correct than mine. </li><li> I can't expect people to act the way I want them to. </li><li> I can still feel OK with myself even if someone else is upset with me (as long as I did not hurt them on purpose). </li><li> I don't have to take this so seriously. </li><li> I have a plan to relax and cope. </li><li> This is funny if you look at it that way. </li><li> I'd rather stick to my goals than stress out. </li></ul> ",

      "text": "As you know, criminalness distracts you from achieving your goals. It means any way of thinking or behaving that violates the rights or well-being of other people...including yourself. Criminalness can include anything from less serious offenses such as cheating at a card game, cutting someone off in line, or calling someone a bad name to more serious offenses such as hiding contraband, fighting with someone, or sexual assault. Being high on criminalness means you are not taking responsibility for yourself and, consequently, not working toward your goals. If you find that you don’t like to follow the rules, are getting into trouble frequently (e.g. disciplinary write-ups, more time in “the hole”), or are arguing a lot with other people, then thisWorksheetis designed to help you.Commit to trying each strategy by saying out loud, “I will do this!” <br><b> Strategies to Try for Boredom or Restlessness</b><br> When people get bored and restless, they look for things to do. Sometimes, this often means people will create their own excitement by doing non- productive or rule-breaking things. When you feel bored or restless, it is time to get busy, but busy in ways that will actually help you achieve your goals. <ul><li> Exercise when you can. Do push-ups or go to the gym when you can. Make sure you break a sweat. Get to the point of exhaustion. You should be tired afterwards. You will release your built-up energy and will exhaust all physical restlessness. A positive side effect is that you will feel healthier. </li><li> Try a new hobby like drawing, writing, reading, singing/rapping, or arts and crafts (make something of your own!). Check your activities log for things you can do now. </li><li> Callonyoursocialsupportnetworkforhelp.Whenyoucan,findotherpeopletotalktoorengageinsome other social activity, like playing basketball or going to the library. Remember to find other supervisees who are following the rules. You will learn more about this in the next module. </li><li> Look for opportunities to work or volunteer your time in meaningful ways. For example, you may be able to run an AA or NA meeting, participate in group therapy, help a religious or spiritual leader, enroll in classes, or find employment. Using your time this way will also look good to your supervising officer.</ul></li> <br><b>Strategies to Try for Self-Injurious Behavior (SIB)</b><br> Some people find that harming themselves (e.g., cutting, burning, scarring) is a way to release built up pain and frustration. Many mental health professionals view harming oneself as a psychiatric symptom. But, as you’ve heard before, it can also be a sign of criminalness. Remember that some people use SIB to manipulate other people or their situation because it can give them special rewards like attention. And, because inmates and supervisees use SIB to manipulate people so often, public safety staff usually see it as a behavioral problem. Consequently, you may receive consequences for it. Although injuring yourself is not criminal, it is an irresponsible, non-helpful way of dealing with emotional pain. If you find that hurting yourself relieves emotional pain, you need to develop alternate coping strategies. Some of these strategies may be helpful. <ul><li> Again, try a good, hard exercise. Working your body to the max can feel painful, but it is a much healthier way of releasing your emotional pain. </li><li> Use the relaxation exercises you previously learned. </li><li> Talkwithsomeonewhocaresaboutyouandthatyoucanconfidein(thesepeopleshouldbeidentifiedin your suicide prevention plan). Talk to your counselor or talk to people who support you. </li><li> Meetwithyourdoctororcounselor.Ifit’sanemergency,gotothehospitalandcallyourSO.Ifyoudoneed to go to the hospital, it might be helpful to share your mental illness with the nurses and doctors so that they can understand your SIB is a symptom not an attempt to manipulate them. If you don’t do this, then they will handle the situation much differently. </li><li> If you must engage in behavior that physically hurts in order for you to \"feel,\" choose less harmful options. For example, rather than cutting or burning yourself, try squeezing your fist tightly and then releasing, taking a very cold shower, eating something aversive (but that you can actually eat) like pepper, or wear a rubber band you can snap on your wrist. </li></ul> <b> Strategies to Try for Poor Motivation to Do Good Things<br> Sometimes people don't have the desire or energy to do \"the right thing,\" to be responsible, or to be prosocial. It is hard work being responsible. Essentially, you don’t get to do what you want, when you want, and how you want to do things all the time. When you are losing the motivation to stay away from crime or rule violations, and you find that you are less and less motivated to be responsible, you need to take immediate steps to increase your motivation to remain responsible as you work towards your goals. <ul><li> Take time to review the personal goals you have developed in this program. Think about the importance of these goals, why you have them in the first place, and use this as motivation to stay responsible.</li><li> Talkwithotherpeopleyouadmireandrespectaboutwhatisimportantinlife.Thiscouldbeyourcounselor, family or friend, supervising officer, or model supervisees or treatment group members who are following the rules and doing well for themselves. If you can’t talk or visit, think about the people you look up to...What do they do right in their lives? What good things do they have because of it? What can you learn from their behaviors? </li><li> Attendareligiousorspiritualserviceandremindyourselfthattherearemoreimportantthingsinlifethan your own wants and desires. </li><li> Remind yourself how bad and terrible being in prison really is and that you don’t want to go back. Look at how other inmates’ criminalness keeps them stuck here and take note of what they get for behaving that way. Tell yourself that you won’t be like them; you can reach your goals. </li><li> Create a small list of necessary things you must get done to remain responsible that particular day. Keep the list realistic and focus on getting those things done. For example, you might include eating all meals, exercising, or keeping your cool when your supervising officer gives you direction. When your motivation returns, you will be able to increase your focus beyond the day-to-day items. </li><li> Committodoingonenicethingforsomeoneelsebeforeyoudoanythingforyourself.Themereactof being friendly or helping another person is prosocial and reinforces a responsible life style. For example, you might say, “thank you” when someone holds the door open for you. Plus, you will hopefully be reminded of how good it feels to do nice things for others rather than always focusing on yourself. </li><li> Contactyourdoctororcounselorandaskforhelpwithyourrecovery.Justbeingabletorecognizeyour criminalness and knowing when to ask for help is a step toward achieving your goals and doing what’s right. </li></ul>",

Jarrod is taking medication for his mental illness and has been working with a counselor, who he meets with briefly one time a week. He started out with a lot of motivation and drive for getting better. He was sick of feeling so bad about himself during his depression, and he didn’t want to get in trouble anymore because of his mania. When Jarrod is depressed, he likes to stay in his apartment alone. He is also easily frustrated and will refuse to comply with his supervising officer’s orders. When Jarrod is manic, he will cut himself with the edge of a piece of paper until he bleeds. Jarrod’s mania also gives him a lot of energy that he doesn’t know what to do with, so he tries to find ways to stir up some excitement. The last time Jarrod was manic, he went to his apartment complex’s parking lotduring a thunderstorm, rolled around on the wet ground, and started banging on front doors yelling about the weather. He even pulled and rattled the railing on the stairs untilit broke. With treatment, Jarrod has been able to manage his symptoms, but lately he has been finding that it is very difficult to keep doing this. Change is harder than he thought, and he doesn’t feel like doing the homework his counselor gave him. He started missing the feeling of being manic and stopped taking his medications. He’s getting restless and is beginning to think there is no real point to changing his behaviors. He is starting to believe that maybe it’s not even possible for him to change.” </i> ",
