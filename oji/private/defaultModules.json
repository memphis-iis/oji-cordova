This was how he earned a living. But, these habits were also part of Blake’s problems that landed him in jail. Blake wants to stay out of trouble, so his goal is to find a full-time job within the next 3 months. This is also a requirement of his supervision. He can’t just walk in anywhere and get hired. He needs help and resources. He takes the bus to the public library and looks through the local newspaper for job ads, uses the computer to make a résumé, and searches the Internet for job openings in his town. Blake also joins a support group for other job seekers and signs up at the employment agency. He asks his brother to help him practice interviewing for jobs – making eye contact, shaking hands, and answering questions. Blake uses money from his savings to buy some nice clothes, so he can make a good impression at his interviews. He soon gets an interview for a job as a maintenance worker at an apartment complex. Blake’s friend, Jake, lives in the same complex. So, he asks Jake to tell him more about the complex – what the residents like and dislike about living there. This information helps Blake play up his strengths (what he can add to the job). Before his interview, he also writes down questions he wants to ask so he’ll be better prepared. Blake doesn’t have a car yet, so he takes the bus.</i>",
